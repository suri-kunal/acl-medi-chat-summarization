The patient has attempted nonsurgical treatments, but the minimal relief, and is an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty. She is currently studying psychology and has been experiencing back pain and swelling in the upper back and neck that has worsened with weight loss. Additionally, the patient experiences rash under the breasts from sweating and bra irritation. Ms. Jones reports that she experiences numbness and tingling in her hands and nipple pain, which is exacerbated by working out and jumping or running. Her pain is controlled by medications she takes such as Propranolol and wine. In terms of her symptoms, she would attribute it to her breasts being approximately 5-10 years old since she was in high school when she first noticed the asymmetrical breasts and noted “lots” of indentations on her shoulders and back, as well as rashes that are present in areas below the breast. This could be from exercising or jumping, or from running with breasts too large to support or dislodging them from weight gain. Alternatively, she believes it is due to the bra strap irritation she has had since the age of 14. she is not planning to have any children and may instead use tobacco, alcohol or drugs for the treatment. Finally, her husband has lost approximately 10 pounds over the past few months but plans to lose 20 more by the summer and hopes to submit for approval in july. His insurance will not be Blue Cross Blue Shield. Currently, he is employed at a new job and anticipates switching to blue cross when his old insurance is switched over.

When this occurs, it can last for several minutes before the episode is over. It is important to note these episodes are rare in number and not to push the patient as she may not be able to complete tasks that she wants to do. If she feels like she needs to finish something she can easily finish it in a few minutes. Additionally, if she experiences chest pain after exerting herself, she slows down a bit and refuels her breath which helps. While episodes may last a while, they usually disappear immediately after that. Endorses to a shortness of breath and shallow breathing. Neurological: Positive hypertension. Diabetes: Refreshing chest discomfort. Cardiovascular: Negative coronary artery disease. Intensity: 10/10

She does not feel shortness of breath or chest pain. This is most likely representative of a coronary artery d-stage of loss of blood flow due to the stress on the vessel, and she describes her legs as being very painful. The pain goes up and down and sometimes it is worse than other times. For approximately 6 months, her ekg has shown sinus rhythm with frequent pvcs, as well as an anterior septum infarct pattern. Today, she takes a pill for this when it does get bad, only when she feels dizzy. Occasionally she passes out, but she denies passing out at this time. End of dictation.  In terms of her family history, it looks like her heart problems run in the family with a 4/10,000 chance of developing a stroke. However, this is not something she was particularly worried about prior to referral. Denies a heart attack. Neurological symptoms are limited to bilateral leg pain, however, that was because his diabetes had progressed and he had gotten sugar diabetes. He was taking insulin, which did not affect his symptoms. Blood pressure is within normal limits.

Respiratory swelling is also present. Effects of this are asymptomatic. Difficulty walking: Constipation of exertion, lightheadedness. Feeling fatigued: Distending of palpitations. Musculoskeletal pain in left leg and right leg: Tendency to bend over to walk a short distance. Symptoms could be related to a related issue, congestive heart failure. Gastrointestinal impact: Endorsement of sugary sweetened food with sugar, talk of possible stroke, diabetes diabetes, heart rate changes, dizziness, low blood pressure, chills, rapid heartbeats, syncope, tachycardia, arrhythmias, dyspnea, at times rapid heartbeat, irregular heart beats, or atypical sleep apnea are all symptoms of the same problem. None of these symptoms match the patient’s age and have ever had a primary care physician. They do not consider her to have a good medical history.

There is a 4/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids. Mildly effusionary coughs and wheezes are present, but without inhalation or rales. Normal heart rhythm and heart murmurs are most likely representative of aortic stenosis. The valve doesn't really open fully in all cases.  

Results

RESULTS  Echocardiogram demonstrates decreased ejection fraction and an anterior septum infarct pattern. Mild radiation to the carotid is normal for age.  

Assessment

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  1. Aortic stenosis. - Medical Reasoning: Given her age and medical history, it is likely that her symptoms are related to her aortism and that she may have had an echocardiogram at some point in the past. Depending on results as well as the severity of her heart murmur, we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation, or further, possibly a heart mon- monitor to assess overall burden of the pvcs. She will follow up 3 to 4 weeks after her ecladycardogram is done to discuss results and next steps.  2. Hypolipidemia is managed by her p. It is possible she might be able to stop her statin if her doctors recommend so. • Medical Treatment: Continue taking amlodipine or lisinopril. We will not change either of those medications."

The patient reports that he was in his yard yesterday and was raking leaves and felt fine and then when he arrived at his house about two hours later his back started tightening up and he started getting pins and needles in my right foot. He tried icing the area and applying ice, but it did not help. During his evaluation, his partner states that their pain is also present when they are standing up. There has been some pain to palpation right around the l5 in the patient's back over the last 6 hours. They have both tried Meloxicam, which does not work for them both. Neither of them have been overly active in recent years so they might not have noticed any prior pain with with the back If if you bend over does that hurt? Partner reports pain when bending over. When they stand up, however, their back doesn't hurt as much. This is not uncommon for this patient as he had surgery 3 years ago and reports he has not had back pain before. His pain tolerance is high, so he would not be saying anything if it was not a problem because it really is. Last week, with his shoulder pain, he thought about rarching leaves but did n’t actually rake leaves. After 2 hours his foot started tingling in one leg and today it has returned to feeling just like it felt a week ago.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Wayne Brown is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of a sore on his right foot that is not healing. He reports he has had this sore for a couple of weeks and it's not getting better, stating he saw his primary care physician and they referred him to you. The patient explains that he used to see a podiatrist but the practice moved and he wasn't able to get another one. This is likely due to his dissatisfaction with the current provider and their inability to care for his symptoms.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  1. Diabetes foot ulcer. - Medical Reasoning: I do not believe any more antibiotics are needed at this time. I believe this wound will heal on its own. We will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and a nice pink tissue is present.  2. Connections to shoes: The patient purchases a new pair of shoes to travel with and the neuropathy I guess i didn't feel that they were too tight at first it was just a blister but it looked a lot worse now i've been putting a band-aid on it. He should wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off of the area. Pulsing and popliteal pulses are palpable. There is minimal granulation tissue. No surrounding erythema or cellulitis, and no evidence of fluid collection. Finally, I want to order an ankle brachial index abi to determine the blood supply to the patient's foot. If the abI is not optimal for wound healing, we may need to refer him to a vascular specialist."

CHIEF COMPLAINT  Right knee pain.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  William Walker is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right knee irritation. The patient reports that he injured his knee while jumping on a trampoline with his wife. He heard a pop as they landed and felt instant pain as he was pronouncing his name and heard her screaming as she heard the snap of her foot and pain in the lateral aspect of the knee. After the incident, Walker took Tylenol which produced immediate pain, and he elevated the injury with some movement. There is no evidence of a fracture or bony abnormality. However, he does have a slight gait and a limp, which he notes is due to his adjustment to activities of daily living. This is likely superficial and will likely resolve on its own. When i listen to your heart, i do like the rate and rhythm and the rhythm has a nice regular rhythm. Regarding your symptoms, we see that your hypertension is still high. Your diabetes is not consistent and we wonder if we might need to adjust medication. You are still taking Lisinopril20 mg daily, but we believe that it is appropriate to increase that to 500 mg weekly when required. For your arthritis, meloxicam is suitable for 15-5 times per week, at your risk for pain and swelling.

His x-ray showed no evidence of a fracture or bony abnormality. We discussed the importance of physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles around the area and to prevent further injury. If he is still having pain with some movement, we will order a MRI and discuss the possibility of further imaging.  2. Hypertension. – Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril at 20 mg. Order a lipid panel. I am concerned that we may not be getting his blood pressure to where we need it to be so we might have to do some medication modification for his second problem with hypertension. A1c is required in order to obtain a better image of his long-term blood glucose levels, as well as his diet. At this time, he has not been compliant with his carb diet and has been inconsistent with the amount of blood sugar he consumes over the past week."

CHIEF COMPLAINT  RECurrent kidney stones.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient came to the hospital yesterday for evaluation of a kidney stone. He was able to pass the stone due to percocet and followed up with a urine culture. This is not the first time that the patient has been experiencing pain in his kidneys. The stone was first diagnosed with the type 2 diabetes a year ago, however, the pain has not gotten any worse. For the last issue for insomnia, we have seen a urologist before about this. We have been monitoring his blood pressure readings about 2 to 3 times a week. Additionally, he is been taking Metformin daily which has also improved his sleep hygiene. When he was here yesterday he got a Pda of 6. His blood sugars were showing tenderness to palpation of the abdomen �, “ GI”. Of note, there was no blood in your urine, but there were some urine cultures that were sent through to urology. In terms of medication use, they did do everything for you. They also gave me some pain medicine, which i think you were taking, and they continued to take it for about three days until this stone passed. There was also some Crestor and norvasc which were also prescribed to help with that diet. However, you are still having pain and your pain is still in the E.r., where blood is being monitored before every meal, as well as blood sugar readings are being noticed by the nurse. She notes that she is monitoring blood flow to her urine and urine ""sugar levels in her stool’s stool ‘ as a precaution ‒

Results

RESULTS  X-rays of the abdomen were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of any kidney stones.  

Assessment

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  1. Kidney stones. - Medical Reasoning: The patient believes her recent kidney stones passed approximately 3 days ago. She also has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and ketoacidosis. We will take a look at all of this before we proceed with any treatment options. At this point, I would like to see the patient get a referral to urology just to check up on that, as well as to have labs performed. I believe she should be able to get that under control if she follows a proper sleep hygiene plan.  2. Hypertension. – Medical Treatment: Continue with Norvasc. Take 2 mg at home as needed. Blood pressure was elevated today, but it was not as high as previously. Laboratory testing will be done to determine if any of her medications are causing the elevated blood pressure. 3. Insulinous issues: This is based on her last visit where her blood sugar was 6.7 and her creatinine was 16, which were normal for her age. Her blood glucose levels have been stable since she was first diagnosed with the type 2 diabetes a year ago, although her a1c was slightly elevated last week, she admits her sensitivity to caffeine has increased recently. All of these issues were addressed in my assessment and plan  Patient Agreements: There were some NTNAs provided to help with her caffeine intake."

There is an effusion present, although there is otherwise no lower extremity edema, and a negative lachman sign. We discussed that she may have been on a motor boat as she was water skiing. I explained that most people recover from this type of injury and do not require surgery. She will be referred to physical therapy to strengthen her muscles around her knee. My plan is to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once a day. This will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain; however, it only has to be taken once and it won't cause any upset stomach or anything like that. Questions: Is she due for a tetanus shot? I have not reviewed the patient's medical record at this time.  2. Hypertensive blood pressure. – Medical Treatment: Continue with lisinopril 20 mg daily.

CHIEF COMPLAINT  Difficulty swallowing.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Tyler Lewis is a 56 -year-old male who presents today complaining of difficulty swallowing and has a past medical history of diabetes, high blood pressure, and retinopathy in eyes. He states he has been skipping his blood sugar checks in the morning and checking his hemoglobin A1c twice daily since 2:00 p.m. Last time was 7.4 and his last blood work result was 99/100 mmHg. The patient denies vomiting blood, colds, or stools, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, for blood in his stool, norvasc, metformin, which is used to control diabetes. His doctor notes that he sometimes has difficulty going about his daily activities, in which case he will need help washing his mouth and gulves down food. Although he denies choking, the patient has admitted to thinking about doing so at times. In order to help him with his swallowing problem, we are going to begin him on prilosec 20 mg once daily on a daily basis and possibly send him to Gastroenterology for a full throat scope. Additional help is also recommended with cold and hot liquids. Additionally, he is recommended to chew more with foods that are larger in size. Examples include steak or meat, soft cheeses, yogurt, even soft vegetables. All of these can be improved by chewing more and by washing down foods with water. This can also be modified with medications that affect the upper respiratory area. Alternatively, patients may have to go to the emergency department if they feel that they could possibly choke. They do admit to having thoughts of choking. There is no significant swelling or mass in their neck when they try to eat solid foods. However, when it comes to soft foods, they may need assistance in pushing them down. When eating something cold or icy cold drinks such as iced tea, it is all okay with liquids; however, with food that is hot, like a hot sandwich it may be more difficult to overcome. • ••• Neurological:

Mom reports chasing her children around the house. Biological plausibility  Medical Assistant told me that you injured your knee when you were coming off the lift and that it sounded like a pop. Patient states that she had been edema over the right knee on x-rays that did not show any bony abnormality but is concerned that they have ruptured your acl or your anterior cruciate ligament. This could result in a medial aspect of the knee being torn. With respect to her son's knee, the patient reports:It hurts on the inside as well as the outside. It also feels like it won't hold my weight. Denies any neuropnea involvement. Neurological  

Exam

PHYSICAL EXAM  Respiratory - Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.  Musculoskeletal - Examination: Edema over the right knee.

Assessment

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  1. Right knee Injury. - Medical Reasoning: The patient is an active 30-year-old mother of two who is currently non- athletic. Her symptoms appear to be caused by a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament ( Acl) and her recent x-ray of her right knee did not show any bony abnormality. She has been placed in a medial aspect brace and is scheduled to receive a knee morphological reconstruction (Mri) in the next couple of days. I am also going to order a baseline knee mri just so that we can get a a good look and confirm her physical exam.  2. Pain level: She is experiencing pain on the outside as she approaches the lift. This coupled with her current symptoms of a numbing and tingling in her toes suggests that she has experienced a traumatic injury to her lateral knee; however, this has not been conclusively explained as to its severity. – Medical Treatment: We will order an MRI and place a Patient Protection and Rehabilitation Plan for the patient."
