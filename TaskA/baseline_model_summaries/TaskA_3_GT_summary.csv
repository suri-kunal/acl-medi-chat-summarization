Patient: Yeah. I feel like I've seen an increase in all the signs before my period. I'm also getting more impatient around that time, but when I'm not on my period, I feel like my mood is better. 
Doctor: When do you see your mood change? 
Patient: My husband says it's bad the week before I start my period, but I think it gets better a day after I start. 
Doctor: Have you seen any bleeding during your cycle?

270,GENHX,"I had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient referred today for evaluation and treatment of chronic sinusitis.  As you are well aware, she is a pleasant 50-year-old female who states she started having severe sinusitis about two to three months ago with facial discomfort, nasal congestion, eye pain, and postnasal drip symptoms.  She states she really has sinus problems, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had much improvement with antibiotics.  She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left.  She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses.  She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness.  Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination.  She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.  She notes her dizziness to be much worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no ear fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring noted in her ears.  She denies any previous history of sinus surgery or nasal injury.  She believes she has some degree of allergy symptoms.","Doctor: Hello, ma'am. What is the reason for your visit today? 
Patient: I was referred by a doctor to come see you so that you could check up on my nasal problems. Here is my report from my previous doctor who referred me to you. 
Doctor: Thank you. Let me take a look.  I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct? 
Patient:  Is that what they're calling my nasal problems? 
Doctor: Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways. 
Patient: I see. Thank you for describing it to me. 
Doctor: No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago? 
Patient: Yeah, I can. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat.
Doctor: Have you ever been prescribed any medication? 
Patient: Here's the list of medicine I was taking. 
Doctor: I see you were given antibiotics, correct? 
Patient: I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me? 
Doctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. 
Patient: I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems. 
Doctor: Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? 
Patient: Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same. 
Doctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? 
Patient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. 
Doctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. 
Patient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. 
Doctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? 
Patient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! 
Doctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? 
Patient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. 
Doctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. 
Patient: Sounds good. 
Doctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. 
Patient: That's reassuring. 
Doctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?  
Patient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. 
Doctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?
Patient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. 
Doctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? 
Patient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. 
Doctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? 
Patient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. 
Doctor: I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? 
Patient: Yeah, I did. 
Doctor: I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs. 
Patient: Sounds good. 
Doctor: Could you look to the left and then look to the right. 
Patient: Oh, wow. That made me very dizzy.

Her difficulties were first noted by family the week prior to Thanksgiving, when they were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play ""Murder She Wrote"" at family gathering. Unbeknownst to the patient was the fact that she had been chosen to be the ""assassin."" Prior to boarding the airplane her children hid a toy gun in her carry-on luggage. As the patient walked through security the alarm went off and within seconds she was surrounded, searched and interrogated. She and her family eventually made their flight, but she seemed unusually flustered and disoriented by the event. In prior times they would have expected her to have brushed off the incident with a ""chuckle."" While in Colorado her mentation seemed slow and she had difficulty reading the lines to her part while playing ""Murder She Wrote."" She needed assistance to complete the game. The family noted no slurring of speech, difficulty with vision, or focal weakness at the time. She returned to work at a local florist shop the Monday following Thanksgiving, and by her own report, had difficulty carrying out her usual tasks of flower arranging and operating the cash register. She quit working the next day and never went back. Her mental status appeared to remain relatively stable throughout the month of November and December and during that time she was evaluated by a local neurologist. Serum VDRL, TFTs, GS, B12, Folate, CBC, CXR, and MRI of the Brain were all reportedly unremarkable. The working diagnosis was ""Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type."" One to two weeks prior to her 1/12/95 presentation, she became repeatedly lost in her own home. In addition, she, and especially her family, noticed increased difficulty with word finding, attention, and calculation. Furthermore, she began expressing emotional lability unusual for her. She also tended to veer toward the right when walking and often did not recognize the location of people talking to her.","Doctor: How old are you?

Doctor: Okay. 
Guest_family: Kids played a trick with her and they hid a plastic gun, a toy gun in her luggage. As she walked through the security, the alarm went off and like within seconds she was all surrounded, and everyone was like panicked. There was so much panic, they searched her and interrogated her and what not. Eventually she and her family made it to the flight, and she seemed unusually frustrated and disoriented by all that. Previously, if any such incident would have happened in the past, she would just have like chuckled and brushed it off. And we all would have sat together and laughed about it. This time it was different. 
Doctor: I can see why she was frustrated. Anyone can be in such situations. 
Guest_family: When we were in Colorado, she seemed slow. She had difficulty reading her lines to her part when we were playing that game. She needed assistance to complete the whole game. 
Doctor: Was she slurring?
Guest_family: Nope. 
Doctor: Was there any difficulty with vision? Or any weakness? 
Guest_family: Nope. Nothing that we noticed. 
Doctor: How was it after returning from there? 
Guest_family: She returned to work. She used to work in a local florist shop. She returned on the Monday following Thanksgiving. And she had difficulty.
Patient:  I was not able to take on with my usual task of flower arrangements or dealing with the cash at the cash register. 
Guest_family: She quit the next day, and she never went back. 
Doctor: How was it after that? 
Guest_family: She seemed to be doing fine and stable throughout November and December, and we were visiting a local neurologist as well, who was evaluating her. He did a few blood tests and did uh, M R I of the brain. He gave us all clear. He said there's nothing there. 
Doctor: Yeah, I see the working diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's Type. When did these symptoms increase? Like when did you started noticing them more? 
Guest_family: One or two weeks ago, so end of December nineteen ninety four, she got lost in her own home.

1096,GENHX,"Ms. XYZ is an otherwise fairly healthy 44-year-old right-handed aircraft mechanic.  On her date of injury, she reports that she was working on an aircraft when she fell between the airplane and a stand with about an 18-inch gap in between.  She injured her left knee and underwent two arthroscopic procedures followed by patellar replacement and subsequently a left total knee arthroplasty in Month DD, YYYY. The patient is seen with no outside images, but an MRI report of the left knee and office notes from Dr. ABCD. The patient reports that she has undergone a full course of physical therapy and complains primarily of pain in the anterior aspect of the left knee and primarily over the medial and lateral tibial components with pain extending proximally to the distal femur and distally down into the anterior tibial plateau area.  She has intermittent numbness and tingling in the posterolateral thigh and no symptoms at all into her feet.  She has axial low back pain as an ancillary symptom.  Her pain is worse with walking and is associated with swelling, popping and grinding.  She complains of pins and needles sensation over the area of the common peroneal nerve overlying the fibular head.  She has no dysesthetic or allodynic symptoms with light touch over the remainder of the knee and the femoral nerve area.  Heavy pressure and light percussion of the fibular head produce painful numbness, tingling, and pins and needles sensation. The patient underwent a left knee MRI in September of 2006 revealing nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but no evidence of an acute fracture or a femoropatellar ligament avulsion or abnormality.  She has continued to complain of persistent instability and pain.  She is not working.  She has a number of allergies to different pain medications and feels that her back has been bothersome mostly due to her gait disturbances relating to her knee.  Her pain is described as constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, pulling, sharp, and stabbing in nature.  It occasionally awakens her at night.  It is better in recumbency with her leg elevated.   Exacerbating factors include standing, walking, pushing, puling.  VAS pain scale is rated as 6/10 for her average and current pain, 10/10 for worst pain, and 3/10 for her least pain.","Doctor: Good morning, Miss X Y Z, correct?

Patient: I write with my right hand. 
Doctor: Finally, what do you do for a living? 
Patient: I'm an aircraft mechanic. 
Doctor: Very nice, so, how did you get hurt?
Patient: Um, I was working on repairing an airplane at work when I fell between the plane and one of the stands.
Doctor: How big was the gap that you stepped in?
Patient: Um, it was about a foot and a half. 
Doctor: Which knee did you hurt?
Patient: It was my left knee.
Doctor: Did you have surgery after the accident?
Patient: Yes I did, I had two arthroscopies, and an, um, patellar replacement after those. 
Doctor: Okay, yes, I see.
Patient: Then, I had a left knee replacement on Month D D, Y Y Y Y.
Doctor: Do you have any imaging of this knee? 
Patient: I didn't have any x rays done, but I have an MRI report and notes from Doctor A B C D. 
Doctor: Can I see that report?
Patient: Yes absolutely, here. 
Doctor: Okay, so this M R I from September two thousand six shows some nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but thankfully there's no evidence of fracture of ligamentous avulsion or abnormality. 
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: There's some bleeding in the bone there, but nothing is broken or out of alignment. 
Patient: Oh, thank you, that's good. 
Doctor: Oh certainly, yes, it is. What treatments have you had for this knee, aside from surgery? 
Patient: I've done a full course of PT for this. 
Doctor: Where is your knee pain? 
Patient: Mostly, it's here in the front of the knee, and then on both sides, like the inside and outside.
Doctor: Does the pain go down your leg at all? 
Patient: Yes, it goes down my, is this the femur? 
Doctor: Yes, that's the femur. 
Patient: Then this must be my tibia, it goes down the front of that too. 
Doctor: Does it go into your thigh at all?
Patient: Yes, it goes into the back of my thigh. I feel numbness and tingling back there. 
Doctor: Do you feel anything in the feet?
Patient: Nope, my feet are completely normal, thankfully.
Doctor: Are you having any back pain? 
Patient: A little, I feel something in my lower back, I'm not sure if it's related.
Doctor: Does anything make your knee pain worse? 
Patient: Yeah, I can hardly walk anymore, it hurts so bad. 
Doctor: What kind of symptoms do you see when you walk on this?
Patient: I feel popping and grinding, and my knee swells up.
Doctor: That numbness and tingling you feel in the thigh, do you feel that in the knee at all?
Patient: Actually yes, it feels like pins and needles there.
Doctor: What about this, when I touch the knee do you feel any abnormal discomfort or pain over the rest of the knee?
Patient: No, nothing out of the ordinary there. 
Doctor: What about this, this is the fibular head, which is where you feel the pins and needles. I'm applying pretty heavy pressure here, how would you describe what you're feeling?
Patient: Um, numbness, tingling, and then that same pins and needles feeling.  
Doctor: Is there any instability? 
Patient: Yes, and there's pain with it too. 
Doctor: Are you working right now?
Patient: No, I'm not right now. 
Doctor: Any allergies I should know about? 
Patient: Yes, actually, I'm allergic to a lot of pain medications. 
Doctor: Okay, have there been any changes in how you're walking?
Patient: Yes, I had to change my walking pattern to take weight off my knee, and I think that has to do with my back pain. 
Doctor: That's certainly a possibility. How would you describe your pain? 
Patient: I'd say its constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, feels like it's being pulled, sharp, and , um, stabbing. All of those words seem fitting. 
Doctor: Okay, does the pain wake you up at night? 
Patient: Yeah, it does occasionally. 
Doctor: Does anything make this feel better?
Patient: Yeah, it gets a little better if I lay down or if I keep my leg elevated. 
Doctor: Out of ten, with ten being the worst pain ever, how would you describe your pain on average? 
Patient: Um, I'd say six out of ten. That's how it is right now, too. 
Doctor: What about at its worst?
Patient: Easily, its ten out of ten. 
Doctor: Finally, what about when the pain is at its least?
Patient: Um, when it's not too bad, I'd say it's a three out of ten. I also have this other M R I report from September of O six, here.

Patient: No one in my family has any health problems.",7
1115,GENHX,"This is a 25-year-old woman who is attending psychology classes.  She was diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004 based on a biopsy consistent with erythema nodosum, but not entirely specific back in Netherlands.  At that point, she had undergone workup which was extensive for secondary diseases associated with erythema nodosum.  Part of her workup included a colonoscopy.  The findings were equivocal characterizes not clearly abnormal biopsies of the terminal ileum. The skin biopsy, in particular, mentions some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis. Prior to the onset of her erythema nodosum, she had a tibia-fibula fracture several years before on the right, which was not temporarily associated with the skin lesions, which are present in both legs anyway.  Even, a jaw cosmetic surgery she underwent was long before she started developing her skin lesions.  She was seen in our clinic and by Dermatology on several occasions.  Apart from the first couple of visits when she presented stating a recurrent skin rash with a description suggestive of erythema nodosum in the lower extremities and ankle and there is discomfort pointing towards a possible inflammatory arthritis and an initial high sed rate of above 110 with an increased CRP.  In the following visits, no evident abnormality has been detected.  In the first visit, here some MTP discomfort detected.  It was thought that erythema nodosum may be present.  However, the evaluation of Dermatology did not concur and it was thought that the patient had venous stasis, which could be related to her prior fracture.  When she was initially seen here, a suspicion of IBD, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus was raised.  She had an equivocal rheumatoid fracture, but her CCP was negative.  She had an ANA, which was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern persistently, but the rest of the lupus serologies including double-stranded DNA, RNP, Smith, Ro, La were negative.  Her cardiolipin panel antibodies were negative as well.  We followed the IgM, IgG, and IgA being less than 10.  However, she did have a beta-2 glycoprotein 1 or an RVVT tested and this may be important since she has a livedo pattern.  It was thought that the onset of lupus may be the case.  It was thought that rheumatoid arthritis could not be the case since it is not associated with erythema nodosum.  For the fear of possible lymphoma, she underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  It was done also in order to rule out sarcoid and the result was unremarkable.  Based on some changes in her bowel habits and evidence of B12 deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B12 in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low MCV, the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease was employed.  The patient underwent an initially unrevealing colonoscopy and a capsule endoscopy, which was normal.  A second colonoscopy was done recently and microscopically no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen.  However, eosinophil aggregations were noted in microscopy and this was told to be consistent with an allergic reaction or an emerging Crohn disease and I will need to discuss with Gastroenterology what is the significance of that.  Her possible B12 deficiency and iron deficiency were never addressed during her stay here in the United States. In the initial appointment, she was placed on prednisone 40 mg, which was gradually titrated down this led to an exacerbation of her acne.  We decided to take her off prednisone due to adverse effects and start her on colchicine 0.6 mg daily.  While this kept things under control with the inflammatory markers being positive and no overt episodes of erythema nodosum, the patient still complains for sensitivity with less suspicious skin rash in the lower extremities and occasional ankle swelling and pain.  She was reevaluated by Dermatology for that and no evidence of erythema nodosum was felt to be present.  Out plan was to proceed with a DEXA scan, at some point check a vitamin D level, and order vitamin D and calcium over the counter for bone protection purposes.  However, the later was deferred until we have resolved the situation and find out what is the underlying cause of her disease. Her past medical history apart from the tibia-fibular fracture and the jaw cosmetic surgery is significant for varicella and mononucleosis. Her physical examination had shown consistently diffuse periarticular ankle edema and also venous stasis changes at least until I took over her care last August.  I have not been able to detect any erythema nodosum, however, a livedo pattern has been detected consistently.  She also has evidence of acne, which does not seem to be present at the moment.  She also was found to have a heart murmur present and we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram placed. Her workup during the initial appointment included an ACE level, which was normal.  She also had a rather higher sed rate up to 30, but prior to that, per report, it was even higher, above 110.  Her RVVT was normal, her rheumatoid factor was negative.  Her ANA was 1:40, speckled pattern.  The double-stranded DNA was negative.  Her RNP and Smith were negative as well.  RO and LA were negative and cardiolipin antibodies were negative as well.  A urinalysis at the moment was completely normal.  A CRP was 2.3 in the initial appointment, which was high.  A CCP was negative.  Her CBC had shown microcytosis and hypochromia with a hematocrit of 37.7.  This improved later without any evidence of hypochromia, microcytosis or anemia with a hematocrit of 40.3. The patient returns here today, as I mentioned, complaining of milder bouts of skin rash, which she calls erythema nodosum, which is accompanied by arthralgias, especially in the ankles.  I am mentioning here that photosensitivity rash was mentioned in the past.  She tells me that she had it twice back in Europe after skiing where her whole face was swollen.  Her acne has been very stable after she was taken off prednisone and was started on colchicine 0.6 daily.  Today we discussed about the effect of colchicine on a possible pregnancy.","Doctor: Hello, miss. Doctor X and I will be going over your medical history with you. Before we begin, could you confirm your age for me?
Patient: I'm twenty five years old. 
Doctor: Thank you. Doctor X, could you go over the diagnosis of erythema nodosum?
Doctor_2: She was diagnosed in two thousand and four after a biopsy was done that confirmed erythema nodosum, but the detail from the Netherlands is not that specific. 
Doctor: What kind of procedures were done to address it? 
Doctor_2: She had undergone a colonoscopy to address secondary diseases that may have been present because of the erythema nodosum, correct miss?
Patient: Yeah, that's correct. 
Doctor: Were there any findings, Doctor X? 
Doctor_2: The findings were uncertain if the terminal ileum had abnormal biopsies. However, the skin biopsy mentioned some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis.
Doctor: I see. Her report states something about a tibia and fibula fracture on her right leg before the erythema nodosum. Are these skin lesions due to the fracture? 
Doctor_2: The skin lesions are not associated with the fracture, correct ma'am? 
Patient: That's correct. The cuts in my skins are on both legs too. Not just the right.
Doctor: Thank you. Did anything occur before the skin lesions? 
Doctor_2: She had cosmetic surgery done on her jaw. 
Doctor: Ma'am, I see you visited our clinic and the Dermatology several times, correct? 
Patient: Yeah, that's correct. I had a rash that I wanted to get checked. 
Doctor_2: I remember that. I was here when she presented the rash. We suggested the rash in her lower extremities and ankles was erythema nodosum. She also had discomfort, which could have been inflammatory arthritis. 
Doctor: Doctor X, did you confirm with any tests? 
Doctor_2: Yes. There was an initial S E D above one hundred and ten and her C P R was increased. 
Doctor: Great. In the visits after, were there any other problems found? 
Doctor_2: The reports says that no other abnormalities were found. However, I do see something about her first visit. 
Doctor: Could you explain what it says?
Doctor_2: She has some M T P detected, which could have been signs of erythema nodosum. However, the Dermatology did not agree, and they believed it to be venous stasis. 
Doctor: The venous stasis could have been related to the fracture, right? 
Doctor_2: That is correct. 
Doctor: Her initial visit reports suspicion of I B D, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus. Why was that? 
Doctor_2: She had a questionable rheumatoid fracture even though her C C P was negative. Her A N A was positive at one to four zero. There was a persistent speckled pattern. However, the rest of the lupus serologies were negative. 
Doctor: What lupus serologies were used? 
Doctor_2: Double stranded D N A, R N P, Smith, R O, and L A were used. 
Doctor: How did her cardiolipin antibodies panel look? 
Doctor_2: They were all negative. We made sure I g M, I g G, and I g A were less than ten. 
Doctor: I see. Was there anything else in the report? 
Doctor_2: She had her beta 2 glycoprotein one or R V V T tested. 
Doctor: That seems important because of the livedo pattern. 
Doctor_2: Exactly. That's why they concluded it was an onset of lupus and not rheumatoid arthritis because the arthritis couldn't be associated with erythema nodosum. 
Doctor: Why did she undergo a C T scan?
Doctor_2: We feared she had lymphoma. The scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis were done to rule out sarcoid. 
Doctor: I see. The results came out normal, right?
Doctor_2: That's correct. 
Doctor: Did you change some of you habits to help your bowels, ma'am? 
Patient: I tried my best to. 
Doctor: That's good. What was found Doctor X? 
Doctor_2: There was evidence of B twelve deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B twelve in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low M C V.
Doctor: That gives the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, right?
Doctor_2: Correct. That's stated in the report. 
Doctor: Were there any tests done to confirm this? 
Doctor_2: She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed nothing. Her endoscopy was also normal. Recently, she underwent a second coloscopy, and no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen after viewing it microscopically. 
Doctor: Nothing was seen microscopically? 
Doctor_2: Actually, we determined there were aggregates of eosinophils. 
Doctor: That sounds important. That could be due to an allergic reaction or an emergence of Crohn Disease. I will have to discuss with Doctor Y from Gastroenterology to see the significance. 
Patient: Could I interrupt for a second? I don't think my B twelve and iron deficiency were looked at while I stayed in the United States. 
Doctor: Is that correct, Doctor X?
Doctor_2: That is. I think these details were from somewhere else. 
Doctor: At least we are aware of it. What medication was provided during her first visit? 
Doctor_2: It looks like she was placed on forty milligrams of prednisone. The strength was reduced over time. 
Doctor: This may be a reason to her acne. Was she taken off this medication?
Doctor_2: Yes, she was. There were too many adverse effects. 
Doctor: What was she places on after?
Doctor_2: It looks like she started a point six m g colchicine, which she took daily. 
Doctor: How were her inflammatory markers after taking it? 
Doctor_2: Her markers were under control and positive. She also didn't have any evidence of erythema nodosum. 
Doctor: That is great. How did you like that medication, ma'am? 
Patient: My ankle would swell up and hurt. There were also some sensitive rashes on the skin of my legs. 
Doctor: I see. Is that stated on the report, Doctor X? 
Doctor_2: It is. I also see that she was reevaluated by Dermatology. 
Doctor: Did they find anything apparent? 
Doctor_2: No, they didn't. They didn't find any evidence of erythema nodosum. 
Doctor: What was the plan following that? 
Docotr_2: It looks like we proceeded with a D E X A scan and checked her vitamin D levels. 
Doctor: Was there any medication prescribed? 
Doctor_2: We ordered vitamin D and calcium to be bought over the counter so that her bones were protected. However, they use of them was stopped until we figured out the underlying cause of her disease. 
Doctor: I see. Other than the fracture and jaw surgery, was there anything else? 
Doctor_2: It shows she had Varicella and Mononucleosis, correct ma'am? 
Patient: Yeah, that's correct. 
Doctor: That's good. Our recent physical exam with you from last August showed changes in your venous stasis and diffuse periarticular ankle edema. Fortunately, we did not find any erythema nodosum, but the livedo patter was still present. 
Patient: I see. Did you find anything else? 
Doctor: We did find a heart murmur, so we will conduct an echocardiogram. Doctor X, could you confirm all the details form the workup, please?
Doctor_2: Of course. Her A C E levels were normal. Her sed rate was around 30, which was high. Before that, it was around one ten, which is even higher. Her R V V T was normal. The rheumatoid factor was negative. The urinalysis was also normal. She had a C R P level of two point three, which was high. Her C C P came out negative. Her C B C displayed microcytosis and hypochromia with hematocrit levels of thirty seven point seven. Her hematocrit levels improved to forty point three later on, and she did not have any hypochromia, microcytosis, or anemia present. 
Doctor: Thank you for all that information. Does all this information and history seem to be correct, ma'am? 
Patient: Yes. Thank you for going over that in front of me. 
Doctor: No problem. I see you're here today regarding some mild but intense skin rashes. You mentioned that you thought it was erythema nodosum, correct? 
Patient: Yeah, that's correct. I think it's on my ankles. I also feel some joint stiffness. 
Doctor: I will take note of that. You also mentioned something about a rash before. Did you have a rash that was sensitive to U V light, like sunlight? 
Patient: That's right. I had it twice when I was in Europe. 
Doctor: When did you notice the rashes? 
Patient: I was skiing, and my face started to swell up. 
Doctor: I see. Do you think it had to do anything with your acne? 
Patient: No. My acne was stable after I stopped taking that one medicine and started the other. 
Doctor: The prednisone and colchicine we mentioned earlier, correct? 
Patient: That's correct. 
Doctor: Is there anything else you would like to ask? 
Patient: I am trying to get pregnant and would like to know if the medication has any effects on pregnancy. 
Doctor: I'll discus that with you right now.

1198,GENHX,"This patient presents to the office today for a checkup.  He has several things to go over and discuss.  First he is sick.  He has been sick for a month intermittently, but over the last couple of weeks it is worse.  He is having a lot of yellow phlegm when he coughs.  It feels likes it is in his chest.  He has been taking Allegra-D intermittently, but he is almost out and he needs a refill.  The second problem, his foot continues to breakout.  It seems like it was getting a lot better and now it is bad again.  He was diagnosed with tinea pedis previously, but he is about out of the Nizoral cream.  I see that he is starting to breakout again now that the weather is warmer and I think that is probably not a coincidence.  He works in the flint and it is really hot where he works and it has been quite humid lately.  The third problem is that he has a wart or a spot that he thinks is a wart on the right middle finger.  He is interested in getting that frozen today.  Apparently, he tells me I froze a previous wart on him in the past and it went away.  Next, he is interested in getting some blood test done.  He specifically mentions the blood test for his prostate, which I informed him is called the PSA.  He is 50 years old now.  He will also be getting his cholesterol checked again because he has a history of high cholesterol.  He made a big difference in his cholesterol by quitting smoking, but unfortunately after taking his social history today he tells me that he is back to smoking.  He says it is difficult to quit.  He tells me he did quit chewing tobacco.  I told him to keep trying to quit smoking.","Doctor: How are you doing today, sir? 
Patient: Honestly, I'm pretty sick today. I've got a lot going on. 
Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?
Patient: Well, it's been off and on for about a month now. 
Doctor: Has it been getting worse recently? 
Patient: Yeah, it has over the last couple weeks. 
Doctor: What are your symptoms? 
Patient: Well, I'm coughing up this yellow phlegm. It feels like everything is in my chest. 
Doctor: What medications have you been taking for this?
Patient: I've been taking Allegra D sometimes, but I'm almost out. I need a refill. 
Doctor: What other problems are you having? 
Patient: My foot keeps breaking out. 
Doctor: Has this improved at all? 
Patient: Well, it was for a while, but now it's really bad again. 
Doctor: Have you been diagnosed with any conditions before? 
Patient: I had, um, tinea pedis before. 
Doctor: How was this treated?
Patient: They gave me Nizoral cream.
Doctor: It has been getting warmer recently, I don't think that this isn't necessarily a coincidence that you're having these symptoms now.
Patient: Yeah, I work in the flint and it's really hot and humid down there.  
Doctor: What else are you dealing with, sir? 
Patient: I have this wart on my right middle finger, are you able to freeze it off? 
Doctor: Have you ever done that before? 
Patient: Yeah, you have done it before, and it went away. 
Doctor: If we've done it before, we can do it again. 
Patient: Cool, can we do blood work, too? I want to check on my prostate. 
Doctor: Well, that's called P S A. 
Patient: Can I have that done? I'm concerned. I am fifty after all. 
Doctor: Sure, we can check your cholesterol too. I know you have history of it being high.
