11,GENHX,"The patient is an 89-year-old lady.  She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup.  Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today's reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague 'stomach problems', although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.  She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her.  She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn.  She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night.  She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth.  They do heal up, but then she will get another one.  She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor.  They do think the Lexapro has helped to some extent.","Doctor: I hear someone has a birthday coming up, how old are you turning, ma'am?
Patient: I'll be ninety later this month, doctor. 
Doctor: You're here for a follow up not very long after your first visit. What seems to be the problem today? 
Patient: Well, actually, my high blood pressure and right arm symptoms are basically gone. 
Doctor: Great, I saw your blood pressure reading for today, and it's much better. Are you taking the higher dose of Mavik we recommended? 
Patient: No, I'm not taking that right now. 
Doctor: How did you tolerate the higher dose? 
Patient: I didn't feel well at all, so I just went back to the old dose. 
Doctor: That was one M G per day, correct? 
Patient: Yes, doctor. I do think I could have some white coat high blood pressure. Doctors' offices make me nervous. 
Doctor: That does happen. Here, try this sample of Tarka, please. 
Patient: What is this for, doctor? 
Doctor: Well, since you're taking the Mavik plus verapamil, you can switch over to Tarka, which is the combined version of the two drugs. 
Patient: I can't take these, doctor. They're too big. 
Guest_family: Hello doctor, I'm her daughter. Just so you know, we check her blood pressure at home periodically and it's always similar to that reading. 
Doctor: Good, so back to that right arm, how is that doing today?
Patient: Well, that pain is basically gone now, I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade. 
Doctor: Did you have x rays taken today? 
Patient: Yes, the tech brought me back right before you came in. 
Doctor: Good, I have the images right here. 
Patient: What do they show, doctor?
Doctor: Well, these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury. 
Patient: What makes you think there's an injury? 
Doctor: Well, look right here. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but do you have any pain here? 
Patient: No, none. 
Doctor: Then we won't worry about it. 
Patient: I am having this stomach pain though, doctor.
Doctor: How has this pain developed and progressed recently? 
Patient: Well, it's improved somewhat with me not taking Aleve anymore. 
Doctor: What medicines are you taking right now, then? 
Patient: Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me. 
Doctor: Do you think this could be acid reflux, or heartburn?
Patient: No, but I take Tums, um, three times a day, and Mylanta at night. Oh yeah, I have these sores in my mouth, can you take a look? 
Doctor: I see. How long have you worn dentures? 
Patient: Oh I couldn't even tell you, it's been many, many years. 
Doctor: Do they come and go, the sores? 
Patient: Yes, one will come, then it'll heal up, then another. 
Doctor: Okay, we'll keep an eye on it. 
Patient: And doctor, since I've been taking the Lexapro, I have some tremors on basically my whole body, at least the upper body, like my torso and arms. 
Doctor: It's hard to tell if you have a tremor today, ma'am, but do you think the Lexapro is helping otherwise?

641,GENHX,"The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and previously moderate mitral regurgitation although not seen recently and I was asked to perform cardiology consultation for her because there was concern for atrial fibrillation after a fall.  Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances, on her driveway, and on her left side hit a rock.  When she came to the emergency room, she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia, and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s, so that was stopped.  Review of EKGs from that time shows what appears to be multifocal atrial tachycardia with followup EKG showing wandering atrial pacemaker.  An ECG this morning showing normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.  Her potassium at that time was 3.1.  She does recall having palpitations because of the pain after the fall, but she states she is not having them since and has not had them prior.  She denies any chest pain nor shortness of breath prior to or since the fall.  She states clearly she can walk and she would be able to climb 2 flights of stairs without problems.","Doctor: Hi, how are you doing?

Doctor: Ha ha. So, it says here they they want me to check you for atrial fibrillation. Yet another fancy word to add to your list. 
Patient: What does it mean?
Doctor: It means I must check if you have faster than normal heartbeat after your fall. In simple words, just to check if there are any irregularities in your heart beating, okay?
Patient: Hm, okay.

Patient: I'm not sure about how it happened, but yeah, I fell yesterday on my driveway and kind of hit a rock.

Doctor: What happened in the emergency room?
Patient: They gave me some medicine. And they put something on my finger. They said that my heart rate was very high. 
Doctor: Yeah, in the record it says that they found rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia. So, according to this, they have given you Cardizem and they stopped it when your heart rate came to fifties.
Doctor: Let me review your electrocardiogram from emergency. It says that there was rapid heart rate. Your heart was really beating very fast and then there was one more electrocardiogram which showed that your pacemaker is acting weird. 
Patient: They also did the same test this morning. 
Doctor: One they did this morning shows normal rate with frequent early heartbeats. Looks like they also tested your blood. Your potassium level is three point one. 
Doctor: How was your heart feeling when you fell yesterday?
Patient: I felt that I just ran in a race. I could feel all the pain after that fall. It was ugly. My heart was pounding so fast it was ready to come out, I never felt like that before in my life. 
Doctor: Did you feel the same way afterwards as well?
Patient: No, it was just after fall. It did not stay like that for long, I was normal later. I never felt it again after that incident. 
Doctor: That is good. Do you have any pain or discomfort in your chest?
Patient: I don't think so.
Doctor: How about before the fall? Did you have any pain or discomfort in your chest before the fall?

He states that a little less than a year ago he developed pain in his right arm.  It is intermittent, but has persisted since that time.  He describes that he experiences a dull pain in his upper outer arm.  It occurs on a daily basis.  He also experiences an achy sensation in his right hand radiating to the fingers.  There is no numbness or paresthesias in the hand or arm. He has had a 30-year history of neck pain.  He sought medical attention for this problem in 2006, when he developed ear pain.  This eventually led to him undergoing an MRI of the cervical spine, which showed some degenerative changes.  He was then referred to Dr. X for treatment of neck pain.  He has been receiving epidural injections under the care of Dr. X since 2007.  When I asked him what symptom he is receiving the injections for, he states that it is for neck pain and now the more recent onset of arm pain.  He also has taken several Medrol dose packs, which has caused his blood sugars to increase.  He is taking multiple other pain medications.  The pain does not interfere significantly with his quality of life, although he has a constant nagging pain.","Doctor: Welcome back.

She underwent an L3-4 decompression in Month DD, YYYY by Dr. Stanley Gertzbein for back and bilateral lower extremity pain.  Shortly after surgery, she began having pain in the right L4 distribution and is seen today with an outside lumbar MRI only.  I have a report of a lumbar CT myelogram as well, but no films.  She has apparently spondylolisthesis and L4-5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes evident at both levels.  According to Dr. Reitman's notes, she is being sent for an L4 selective nerve root block to rule out whether or not she would be a candidate for a TLIF at L4-5.  Her MRI films are reviewed.  These reveal grade 2 L4 anterior spondylolisthesis without significant canal stenosis, though she has facet joint arthropathy at this level and dorsal postoperative changes.  She has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right, as well as a severely degenerated disc at L3-4. The patient complains essentially of pain along the anterior tibia and along the right hip, which his burning, shooting, aching and constant in nature.  It is worse with standing and walking.

He received no treatment and the diplopia spontaneously resolved. He did well until one year prior to presentation when he experienced sudden onset horizontal binocular diplopia.

The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow.  After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure.  Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve.  At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced.  This was explained to the father.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms.  All questions were answered.  The father agreed to the above plan.","Doctor: Good afternoon, who's the victim today, sir? Is it you, or your daughter?

Guest_family: They said her arm was broken, and they tried to do a reduction.
Doctor: Do you have those x rays with you right now?
Guest_family: Yeah, I have them right here, take a look, please. 
Doctor: Well, these x rays show an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture, as well as a mildly angulated radial shaft break. 
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: Well, in short, you broke the inside part of your elbow. In addition to the pain, do you have any burning or tingling feelings in that arm?
Patient: Yes, I do.

Doctor: We need to do an O R I F procedure A S A P. I'll reduce that radial shaft fracture at the same time.
Guest_family: O R I F? What's that
Doctor: I'll put some pins in the elbow, in order to stabilize the break, and we can start the healing process. 
Guest_family: Will this not heal on its own? 
Doctor: No, we need to do the surgery. 
Guest_family: Okay, what are the risks of infection with the surgery? 
Doctor: Historically, its less than one percent.

Doctor: We use prophylactic antibiotics, this helps us control for infection the entire time. 
Guest_family: Will she be asleep for this?
Doctor: Yes, she won't feel a thing.
