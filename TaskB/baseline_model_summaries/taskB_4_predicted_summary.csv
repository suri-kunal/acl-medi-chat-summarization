Joint pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Andrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. He presents today with complaints of joint pain.

The patient reports that over the weekend, he was moving boxes up and down the basement stairs. By the end of the day, his knees were very painful. The pain is equal in the bilateral knees. He states that he has had some knee problems in the past, but he believes that it was due to the repetition and the weight of the boxes. He states that the pain does not prevent him from doing his activities of daily living. By the end of the day on Saturday, his knee soreness interrupted his sleep. The patient has taken Tylenol and iced his knees for a short period of time, but nothing really seemed to help.

The patient states that he had a kidney transplant a few years ago for some polycystic kidneys. He notes that he saw Dr. Gutierrez a couple of weeks ago, and everything was normal at that time. The patient continues to utilize his immunosuppressant medications.

Regarding his hypothyroidism, the patient states that he is doing well. He has continued to utilize Synthroid regularly.

In regards to his arthritis, the patient states that occasionally he has pain in his elbow, but nothing out of the ordinary.

He denies any other symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and weight loss.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Andrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. He presents today with complaints of joint pain.

Arthritis.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient reports increased joint pain in his bilateral knees over the past weekend. Given that his right knee x-ray was unremarkable, I believe this is an acute exacerbation of his arthritis.
• Additional Testing: We will order an autoimmune panel for further evaluation.
• Medical Treatment: Initiate Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours as needed.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to rest his knees. If his symptoms persist, we can consider further imaging and possibly a referral to physical therapy.

Hypothyroidism.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well on Synthroid and is asymptomatic at this time.
• Additional Testing: We will order a thyroid panel.
• Medical Treatment: Continue Synthroid.

Status post renal transplant.
• Medical Reasoning: He is doing well and has been compliant with his immunosuppressive medications. On recent labs, his white blood cell count was within a normal limits and his kidney function is stable.
• Medical Treatment: Continue current regimen.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."," [doctor] hi , andrew , how are you ? [patient] hi . good to see you .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. John Perry is a 61-year-old male with a past medical history significant for kidney stones, migraines, and gastroesophageal reflux, who presents with some back pain.

The patient reports that he is feeling a lot of the same pain that he had when he had kidney stones about 2 years ago, so he is a little concerned. The pain started from the right side and moved over and he feels it on the left side of his back. This has been going on for the last 4 days. Initially, the pain was intermittent, but over the last 48 hours it has been constant. He has taken Tylenol, but it does not seem to help. He thinks he has hematuria, but it is hard to detect but it does look a little off color. He endorses nausea and vomiting if he exerts himself or climbs the stairs to his apartment or runs to catch the bus. He also endorses dizziness and lightheadedness with pain in his abdomen.

Regarding his migraines, he has been diligent about taking the Imitrex. He denies issues with the migraines.

Regarding his gastroesophageal reflux, he reports that he has been doing well with his diet, but notes lately with his pain, he has been eating more fast food and takeout since these options come with delivery. He is staying hydrated. He is taking Protonix 40 mg daily as directed.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Mr. John Perry is a 61-year-old male with a past medical history significant for kidney stones, migraines, and gastroesophageal reflux, who presents with back pain.

Kidney stones.
• Medical Reasoning: He is experiencing pain in his back that is similar to his previous kidney stone pain. His recent abdominal x-ray demonstrates what appears to be a recurrent kidney stone.
• Additional Testing: I have ordered a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast.
• Medical Treatment: We will start him on Ultram 50 mg as needed every 6 hours for pain.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to stay well hydrated and to strain his urine.

Migraines.
• Medical Reasoning: He has been compliant with Imitrex and is doing well at this time.
• Medical Treatment: Continue Imitrex.

Reflux.
• Medical Reasoning: This is typically well-controlled with dietary modifications.
• Medical Treatment: Continue with Protonix 40 mg daily. A refill was provided.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

The patient is a 48-year-old female who presents for shortness of breath. She has a history of depression, smoking and chronic back pain.

The patient reports shortness of breath with mild exercise and walking. She also notes some palpitations at times. She is not sure if it is due to her back pain or not. The patient states she has been exercising more. She continues to smoke but has decreased from two packs a day down to a couple of cigarettes daily.

Regarding her depression, the patient feels that it is well managed on Effexor.

Regarding her chronic back pain, the patient has been taking Neurontin, which she states is helping control her pain. She states she tries to get as much rest as she can. She is no longer doing yoga as she has not made it a habit.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Cardiovascular: Endorses dyspnea on exertion. Endorses palpitations.
• Respiratory: Endorses shortness of breath.
• Musculoskeletal: Endorses back pain.
• Integumentary:
• Psychiatric: Endorses depression.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Respiratory: Mild wheezes bilaterally.

RESULTS

Pulmonary function test demonstrates mild asthma and the appearance of COPD.

X-ray of the chest demonstrates flattening of the diaphragm which is consistent with COPD.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

COPD.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient presents today with shortness of breath with exertion. Her pulmonary function tests suggest asthma or COPD and her most recent chest x-ray and physical examination today are also consistent with COPD.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I counseled the patient on the importance of smoking cessation.
• Medical Treatment: We will start the patient on Combivent, 2 puffs twice a day. I will also prescribe an albuterol inhaler, 2 puffs as needed, and a prednisone taper pack.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: It sounds like her depression is stable, so we will not change anything at this time.
• Patient Education and Counseling: She will keep taking the Effexor. I encouraged her to practice yoga for depression relief as well as her back pain.

Chronic back pain.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient says she is doing well on Neurontin with only occasional exacerbation of the pain.
• Medical Treatment: She can continue Neurontin as is. I also encouraged her to practice yoga for her back pain.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."," [doctor] thanks , rachel . nice , nice to meet you . [patient] yeah .

virtscribe,D2N021,"[doctor] next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 .
[doctor] hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ?
[patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great .
[patient] yes , i did .
[doctor] anything new since your last visit ?
[patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .
[doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ?
[patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .
[doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 .
[patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?
[doctor] yep , right here .
[patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .
[doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself .
[patient] that would be great .
[doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days .
[patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .
[doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well .
[patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?
[doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study .
[patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .
[doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ?
[patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so , i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freer since , um , i'll be on vacation after july 8th .
[doctor] okay , good .
[patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?
[doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ?
[patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .
[doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ...
[patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .
[doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much .
[patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .
[doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you .
[patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .
[doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated .
[patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .
[doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing .
[patient] okay , thank you . got it .
[doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ?
[patient] no , not that i know of .
[doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .
[doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ?
[patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .
[doctor] okay . we might give you some of that .
[patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .
[doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ?
[patient] yes , i also do have that problem .
[doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that .
[patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .
[doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , sounds good .
[patient] great .
[doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs .
[patient] okay , i will do that .
[doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future .
[patient] okay , that's okay .
[doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not .
[patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .
[doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range .
[patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .
[doctor] okay , great . let's see them .
[patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .
[doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 .
[patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .
[doctor] yeah , this is much better .
[patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .
[doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time .
[patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?
[doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices .
[patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .
[doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan .
[patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?
[doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started .
[patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?
[doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] does that make sense ?
[patient] yes , it does .
[doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study .
[patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?
[doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you .
[patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .
[doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify .
[patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .
[doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up .
[patient] and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you .
[patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .
[doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be .
[patient] okay , will do .
[doctor] perfect . so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know .
[patient] i will . thank you so much for your help on that .
[doctor] you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] but , you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] um , so , that's that . and then , let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low-carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods , and low chole- cholesterol foods .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and again , once you finish your dose of vitamin d , for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000iu daily , so that you're able to maintain those levels . sound good ?
[patient] yes , that sounds great .
[doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight , though .
[patient] okay , that would be great .
[doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try once called phexxi , which is kind of like a spermicide , basically .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] if you need some , uh , just let me know .
[patient] okay , i will . i'll let you know .
[doctor] okay , perfect . so , stay put for me now . i'm going to go see if they have discount samples , and bring you that prescription . and then , i'm going to order the labs for next time .
[patient] okay , great , thank you so much .
[doctor] you're welcome .
[doctor] so , under the plan , under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal . two out of three salivary cortisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's , and therefore we're ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we'll try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin , and remove the previous information . on the hyperthyroidism , we'll print out her prescriptions . unithroid should be better priced with the discount card , and we'll repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Hypothyroidism.
Abnormal liver enzymes.
Abnormal weight gain.
Acne vulgaris.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Christine Hernandez is a 39-year-old female who presents today for evaluation and management of abnormal liver enzymes and hypothyroidism.

When the patient was last seen, her thyroid medicine was changed to Unithroid, but due to the cost of $75, she has not yet started the new medicine and continues taking her previous thyroid medicine. She denies utilizing the coupon that was previously recommended for the Unithroid. Similarly, the patient was prescribed Epiduo for her acne vulgaris, which she did not fill due to the cost of $100. She tried filling both prescriptions at Walmart.

Mrs. Hernandez still presents with abnormal weight gain. She questioned if her oral contraceptive Microgestin, which was discontinued, could have been the cause. Additional symptoms included acne, hirsutism. She is attempting to modify her intake and plans to resume her gym membership in July as she will be on vacation. She inquired about the impact on weight loss of chromium, CLA, and amino acids.

The patient confirmed that she is taking her high dose Vitamin D as prescribed. She does suffer from constipation and she treats with MiraLAX.

She denies previous treatment for her acne vulgaris. She denies ever using clindamycin topical antibiotic. She reports having sensitive skin, developing rashes with various skin products.

ASSESSMENT

• Hypothyroidism.
• Abnormal liver enzymes.
• Abnormal weight gain.
• Acne vulgaris
• Vitamin D deficiency.
• Hirsutism

PLAN

Hypothyroidism
The patient will again attempt to initiate Unithroid. I have printed out the prescription and a discount card, which should result in a reduced price. She will contact my office if she encounters additional issues.

Abnormal liver enzymes
We have seen improvement since the discontinuation of Microgestin. I recommended the spermicide Phexxi for alternative birth control. The patient will also continue working on weight loss, which should additionally improve her liver enzymes.

Abnormal weight gain
Cushing’s Syndrome has been ruled out. I reviewed the weight loss study with the patient, she will call within a month if she is interested in participating. I advised her to follow a low carbohydrate, low cholesterol, abstain from alcohol, and reduce fatty foods diet.

Acne vulgaris
Epiduo was not covered and too expensive. The patient will try benzoyl peroxide and Clindamycin separately to see if the price improves.

Vitamin D deficiency
The patient will complete the high dose vitamin D and then should start vitamin D 2000 IU per day to maintain her levels.

Hirsutism
Her androgen levels were normal.

INSTRUCTIONS

She will repeat all labs prior to her next visit.
"," [doctor] next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 . [doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . [patient] yes , i did . [doctor] anything new since your last visit ? [patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one . [doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ? [patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 . [doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 . [patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ? [doctor] yep , right here . [doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself . [patient] that would be great . [doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days . [patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that . [doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well . [patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ? [doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [patient] okay . [doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too . [doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? [patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then . [doctor] okay . [doctor] okay , good . [doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ? [patient] i'm not sure what it is , either . [doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [patient] okay . [doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you . [doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you . [patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout . [doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated . [patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know . [doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing . [patient] okay , thank you . got it . [doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ? [patient] no , not that i know of . [patient] yes . [doctor] all right . [doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ? [doctor] okay . we might give you some of that . [patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot . [doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ? [patient] yes , i also do have that problem . [doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that . [patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that . [doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart . [patient] okay . [doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again . [patient] okay . [doctor] all right , sounds good . [patient] great . [doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles . [patient] okay . [doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs . [patient] okay , i will do that . [doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future . [patient] okay , that's okay . [doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not . [patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though . [doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range . [patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal . [doctor] okay , great . let's see them . [patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago . [doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 . [patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 . [doctor] yeah , this is much better . [patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december . [doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time . [patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ? [doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency . [patient] okay . [doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices . [patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs . [doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan . [patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ? [doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started . [doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance . [patient] okay . [doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo . [patient] okay . [doctor] does that make sense ? [patient] yes , it does . [doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study . [patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ? [doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you . [patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes . [doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify .

[doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you . [patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now . [doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be .

[patient] yes , that sounds great . [doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight , though . [patient] okay , that would be great . [doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try once called phexxi , which is kind of like a spermicide , basically . [patient] okay . [doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse . [patient] okay . [patient] okay , i will . i'll let you know . [doctor] okay , perfect . so , stay put for me now . i'm going to go see if they have discount samples , and bring you that prescription . and then , i'm going to order the labs for next time . [patient] okay , great , thank you so much . [doctor] you're welcome . [doctor] so , under the plan , under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal . two out of three salivary cortisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's , and therefore we're ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we'll try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin , and remove the previous information . on the hyperthyroidism , we'll print out her prescriptions . unithroid should be better priced with the discount card , and we'll repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks ."," [doctor] next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 . [doctor] hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ? [doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . [patient] yes , i did . [doctor] anything new since your last visit ? [patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one . [doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ? [patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 . [doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 . [patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ? [doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself . [patient] that would be great . [doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days . [patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that . [doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well . [patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ? [doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [patient] okay . [doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too . [doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? [patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then . [doctor] okay . [doctor] okay , good . [patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ? [patient] i'm not sure what it is , either . [doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ... [patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss . [doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [patient] okay . [doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you . [doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you . [patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout . [doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated . [patient] okay , thank you . got it . [doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ? [patient] yes . [doctor] all right . [patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products . [doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ? [patient] no , i've never tried anything for it . [doctor] okay . we might give you some of that . [patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot . [doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ? [patient] yes , i also do have that problem . [doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that . [doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart . [patient] okay . [patient] okay . [doctor] all right , sounds good . [patient] great . [doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles . [patient] okay . [doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs . [doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future . [doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not . [patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though . [doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range . [doctor] okay , great . let's see them . [patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago . [patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 . [doctor] yeah , this is much better . [doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time . [patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ? [doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency . [patient] okay . [patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs . [doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan . [doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started . [patient] okay , and what's involved with that ? [doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance . [patient] okay . [doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo . [patient] okay . [doctor] does that make sense ? [patient] yes , it does . [doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify . [patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it . [doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that . [patient] okay . [doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up . [doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you . [patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now . [doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be . [patient] okay , will do . [doctor] you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Christina Hernandez is a pleasant 38-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of her symptoms of an abnormal liver enzymes and a vitamin d deficiency. The patient reports that she has been trying to get better by following a diet plan developed by her cousin, who does not work out daily and has lost some weight, but she plans to start back at the gym in july due to her contract, which was put in place until then. She denies any constipation, and she denies having any rash or pain, or swelling in her feet, ankles and knees. Her growth hormone test was normal and within the range of what we would expect for cushing's syndrome. Unfortunately, her salivary cortisol levels were abnormal and out of range for our bloodwork. This is not uncommon for women who have abnormal weight gain and/or weight loss, however, none of these symptoms are present in a systemic manner. There is some evidence that blood in the patient's feet and ankles may swell up from the sun's light, so be sure to apply it at night, if it happens during the day. Additionally, patients have been constipating. They are offered mira- Miralax which is an alternative to epi-pen. We will be adding another set of labs to replace the ones that were previously done by your doctor. Finally, patients with abnormal psychiatric systems, such as schizophrenia, bipolar, etc., will need to reapply their labs until we are satisfied that their symptoms have improved since discontinuation of their birth control. All patients are welcome to visit our office without having to double check for any medications that they might have previously been prescribed by their doctors.

She completed the covid vaccine in february of this year. The patient states that she has been working out every day since then. Her symptoms have improved since discontinuation of her birth control. They have dropped in january, and then it dropped a little more in march, since i stopped taking the medicine in december. Of note, the prices were high on the new one, but they were still cheaper).  On the hyperthyroidism, she mentioned that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance, so she would need to see the Hyperandrogynism or high testosterone. OR, She denies prescriptions to patients who have a history of schizophrenia, bipolar, or Taylors’ names.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS  • Constitutional: Endocrine: Denies depression. • VITALS: Clindamycin topical as an antibiotic for your acne. • Cortioagone: Derivative: Non-hirsutism: Reports acne, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, etcetera  ","ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  1. Hirsutism. - Medical Reasoning: The patient does not have cushing's syndrome. She did pass the dexamethasone test, and her salivary cortisol levels were normal during her baseline testing. Her abnormal liver enzymes have not improved since discontinuation of her birth control. We will continue to monitor her. In the meantime, she has been on a low-carb diet, avoid alcohol and fatty foods. Low chole-leasing hormone (SHPLE ) was also tested and is in decent range, as was her pituitary-ferium level. All of these seem to be normal to me. I do not see an endocrine cause for her size (Figure 1 ) or her labs, therefore, we will need to refer her for further evaluation.  2. Weight loss: She will receive a stipend for partici- for participating in the study.She will also receive parking and a month's worth of supplies provided by the company.","ASSESSMENT  • Medical Reasoning: Mrs. her liver enzymes improved since discontinuation of her birth control. Under abnormal weight gain, dexamethasone suppression test was normal. 2 out of 3 salivary cortisol tests were normal, not consistent with cushing's, and therefore we're ruling out cushes's. • Additional Testing: We will provide her with a topical antibiotic, plus a benzoyl peroxide to help with her Hypertension.

CHIEF COMPLAINT  Weight loss study.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Christina Hernandez is a pleasant 38-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of her symptoms of an abnormal liver enzymes and a vitamin d deficiency. The patient reports that she has been trying to get better by following a diet plan developed by her cousin, who does not work out daily and has lost some weight, but she plans to start back at the gym in july due to her contract, which was put in place until then. She denies any constipation, and she denies having any rash or pain, or swelling in her feet, ankles and knees. Her growth hormone test was normal and within the range of what we would expect for cushing's syndrome. Unfortunately, her salivary cortisol levels were abnormal and out of range for our bloodwork. This is not uncommon for women who have abnormal weight gain and/or weight loss, however, none of these symptoms are present in a systemic manner. There is some evidence that blood in the patient's feet and ankles may swell up from the sun's light, so be sure to apply it at night, if it happens during the day. Additionally, patients have been constipating. They are offered mira- Miralax which is an alternative to epi-pen. We will be adding another set of labs to replace the ones that were previously done by your doctor. Finally, patients with abnormal psychiatric systems, such as schizophrenia, bipolar, etc., will need to reapply their labs until we are satisfied that their symptoms have improved since discontinuation of their birth control. All patients are welcome to visit our office without having to double check for any medications that they might have previously been prescribed by their doctors.  CURRENT MEDICATIONS  Cholesterol: 222. Hdl: 178. Non-essential fatty foods: 153. Vitamin D: D1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,20,25,30,31,36,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,51,52,53,54,56,60,63,64,75,80,90,100,112,140,15,ONE-TIME IMPACT OF STORIES  Musculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain and ankle swellings.

Results

RESULTS  Labs for cholesterol and thyroid were reviewed and reviewed, and they are all within normal limits.  Non-HDL and non-hydroxy-citric triglyceride were in normal ranges.Â  

Assessment

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  1. Hirsutism. - Medical Reasoning: The patient does not have cushing's syndrome. She did pass the dexamethasone test, and her salivary cortisol levels were normal during her baseline testing. Her abnormal liver enzymes have not improved since discontinuation of her birth control. We will continue to monitor her. In the meantime, she has been on a low-carb diet, avoid alcohol and fatty foods. Low chole-leasing hormone (SHPLE ) was also tested and is in decent range, as was her pituitary-ferium level. All of these seem to be normal to me. I do not see an endocrine cause for her size (Figure 1 ) or her labs, therefore, we will need to refer her for further evaluation.  2. Weight loss: She will receive a stipend for partici- for participating in the study.She will also receive parking and a month's worth of supplies provided by the company.","Subjective

CHIEF COMPLAINT  Weight loss study.  MEDICAL HISTORY  Patient is christine Hernandez, age 42. She completed the covid vaccine in february of this year. The patient states that she has been working out every day since then. Her symptoms have improved since discontinuation of her birth control. They have dropped in january, and then it dropped a little more in march, since i stopped taking the medicine in december. Of note, the prices were high on the new one, but they were still cheaper).  On the hyperthyroidism, she mentioned that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance, so she would need to see the Hyperandrogynism or high testosterone. OR, She denies prescriptions to patients who have a history of schizophrenia, bipolar, or Taylors’ names.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS  • Constitutional: Endocrine: Denies depression. • VITALS: Clindamycin topical as an antibiotic for your acne. • Cortioagone: Derivative: Non-hirsutism: Reports acne, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, etcetera

virtscribe,D2N022,"[doctor] this is philip gutierrez , date of birth 1/12/71 . he is a 50-year-old male here for a second opinion regarding the index finger on the right hand . he had a hyperextension injury of that index finger during a motor vehicle accident in march of this year . he was offered an injection of the a1 polyregion , but did not want any steroid because of the reaction to dexamethasone , which causes his heart to race . he was scheduled to see dr. alice davis , which it does n't appear he did . he had an mri of that finger , because there was concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of , quote , "" fds tendon , "" end quote . he has been seen at point may orthopedics largely by the physical therapy staff and a pr , pa at that institution .
[doctor] at that practice , an mri was obtained on 4/24/2021 , which showed just focal soft tissue swelling over the right index mcp joint , partial-thickness tear of the right fds , and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the fdp and fds tendons . radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index mcp joint were intact , as the mcp joint capsule . extensor tendons also deemed intact .
[doctor] his x-rays , four views of the right hand today , show no bony abnormalities , joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand , no soft tissue shadows of concern , no arthritis . hi , how are you , mr . gutierrez ?
[patient] i'm good , how about you ?
[doctor] well , how can i help you today ?
[patient] so i was a passenger in , uh , a car that was rear-ended , and we were hit multiple times . i felt two bumps , which slung me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger .
[doctor] so hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards ?
[patient] um , i do n't really know . i just felt , like , it felt like i laid on my finger , and so , i felt like it went back , and it's been hurting since about march . and it's been like that ever , ever since the wreck happened . so i , and i ca n't make a fist , but sometimes the pain's unbearable . and , like , even driving hurts .
[doctor] okay , so this was march of this year , so maybe about three months ago ?
[patient] yeah , and it's still swollen . so i was seeing , uh , an orthopedist , and they sent me to an occupational therapist . and i've been doing therapy with them , and then they sent me to go back and get an mri . so i went and got the mri . uh , then they told me that the mri came back , and it said i had a tear in my finger , but he was n't gon na give me an injection , because the injection was going to make the tear worse .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] and then , after he got the mri , he said that i have , uh , a tear in my finger , and that he did n't wan na do surgery , but he would do an injection . then i'm thinking that you told me you would n't do an injection in there , and then the oper- , occupational therapy says it's because of the tear . and then , they do n't want me to keep rubbing the thing , and doing things with my hand . so i feel like i'm not getting medical care , really .
[doctor] yeah , i see that .
[patient] so i came to see if you could do anything for this hand , because i am right-handed , and i kinda need that hand .
[doctor] what do you do for a living ?
[patient] uh , i'm an x-ray tech .
[doctor] well , um , so do you have any diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] uh , do you take any chronic medications of su- , significance ?
[patient] uh , i do take a blood pressure pill , and that's it .
[doctor] okay , and it looks like you suffer from itching with the methylprednisolone ?
[patient] uh , that's correct .
[doctor] all right , well , i'm gon na scoot up closer and just take a quick look at your hand . all right , so , lean over here . all right , so on this exam today , we have a very pleasant , cooperative , healthy male , no distress . his heart rate is regular rate , rhythm , 2+ radial pulse , no swelling or bruise , bruising in the palm over the volar surface of his index finger , normal creases , slightly diminished over the pip of the index finger compared to the middle finger .
[doctor] his index finger rests in a 10-degree pip-flexed , uh , position . all right , is that uncomfortable to correct that , and is it uncomfortable now here ?
[patient] yeah , uh , when you push on it , yeah .
[doctor] all right , how about here ?
[patient] um , there , it's not .
[doctor] okay , not as bad ?
[patient] yeah , it feels , uh , a little numb .
[doctor] gotcha , all right . bend , bend the tip of this finger . bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . keep bending . all right , straighten it out . all right , and now , bend it for me as best you can .
[patient] my goodness . it feels like it's , it's tearing in there .
[doctor] okay , okay . well , bend the tip of this finger , and bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . all right , straighten that out , and now , bend it for me as best you can . all right , good . now , bend that finger , and i'm going to pull , put it down like this . and then bend that finger for me . okay , sorry , can you bend it for me ? all right . now , make a fist . great , so relax the finger . all right , so just keep it , keep , when i bend the finger , we're just going to bend that finger where it meets the hand . is that okay there ?
[patient] ow , .
[doctor] okay , okay . so all the hurt , it seems , is stretching , because you have n't been doing this for so long . so , you know what i mean ? so , um , you're going to have to start really doing that .
[patient] well , i've tried . i even bought myself a splint .
[doctor] well , but a splint does n't help move you . it actually immobilizes you .
[patient] okay . i thought it would straighten it out .
[doctor] no , no . so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me , as hard as you can , and keep going , going . all right , so , so you're okay . all right , so i would say the following , that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds , and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds , the flexor digitorum superficialis , which is the least important of the two .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] uh , now , there's two halves of it . so it's a partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important , and the other one is just fine .
[patient] so the good one is good ?
[doctor] yes , correct . so the one that goes all the way to the tip is good .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] yeah , so you know , i think what you have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the fds tendon blocking excursion of these other tendons , that they ca n't get through to the pulley .
[patient] okay , all right .
[doctor] so what i would recommend what we try is a cortisone injection , and i would avoid the dexamethasone , because i saw you have a little reaction to that . but we could use the betamethasone , which is a celestone .
[patient] i've gotten another , uh , methylprednisolone , and that itched me like crazy .
[doctor] did it ? yeah , this one is water-soluble , and i think it's fairly low toxicity , but high benefit , and i think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that finger .
[patient] all right , we'll give it a try .
[doctor] good . so , you do the shot , and it's going to take about three to five days before it starts feeling better . and then probably over the next couple of weeks , it'll start feeling even better .
[patient] perfect .
[doctor] all right , so take advantage of that . you've got ta start moving the finger . you're not going to tear anything or break a bone , uh , because your intensors , extensors are intact . but your collateral ligaments are intact , so you've got a stiff , sore finger . i'm going to try to help as much as i can with this soreness part , and then you have to do all the stiff part .
[patient] the lady in occupational therapy tried some maneuvers to straighten the finger out , but it even hurt after i left . the whole thing just swelled up .
[doctor] hmm . okay , so it was injured , and you had scar tissue . and then , you had post-traumatic inflammation . and so , this will help some with all of that . it's not going to make it to where your finger is like , , my finger does n't hurt at all , but it will make it to where at least tolerable , to where you can make some gains . and we actually might need to repeat this as well .
[patient] will i be able to drive ? i drove myself here today , so ...
[doctor] yeah , it may feel a little weird , but it's totally safe for you to drive .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so for mr . gutierrez , just put that he has a post-traumatic rather severe stenosing tenosynovitis of his right index finger , and the plan is steroid injection today , do a trigger injection , but i'm using a cc of betamethasone . so , mr . gutierrez , do you have , um , therapy scheduled or set up ?
[patient] uh , not at the moment .
[doctor] all right , well , i mean , you know that you need to move that finger , and i think to the degree that they can help you do that . so i want you to move that finger , finger , but i think it would be , uh , beneficial for you to have an accountability , um , so at least you know to check in with them once a week with somebody .
[patient] um , okay . that's kinda why i'm here , for you to tell me what needs to be done , you know ?
[doctor] yeah , so i'll write you out , um , an outpatient prescription . i think if you go back to the same people where you were before , i'm hoping that after this injection , you're going to be able to do a whole lot more with them . so let's do outpatient once a week for six weeks , um , and then full active and passive range of motion is the goal with no restrictions .
[patient] all right , sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right , well , i will have the nurse set up the injection procedure , and we'll , and i'll be back shortly .
[patient] thanks , doc .

Right index finger hyperextension injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion regarding evaluation of the right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in 03/2021.

In summary, the patient was the passenger in a vehicle that was rear-ended. He reports they were hit multiple times as he felt 2 bumps which caused his to sling forward hyperextending his right index finger. He was offered an injection of the A1 pulley region, but he did not want any steroid due to a reaction to dexamethasone that causes his heart to race. The patient was scheduled to see Dr. Alice Davis, but he has not seen his yet. The patient has been seen at Point May Orthopedics, by the physical therapy staff and a physician assistant at that practice. He underwent an MRI of the right index finger because they were concerned about a capsular strain plus or minus a rupture of the ""FDS tendon.""

The patient states that he is unable to make a fist secondary to pain and swelling in the right index finger. He describes a pulling, tearing sensation in the right index finger. The pain is exacerbated by driving. He notes that he has been wearing a right index finger splint.

The patient denies any history of diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. He reports only taking medication for hypertension and denies taking any other chronic medications of significance. He also notes methylprednisolone causes his to itch.

Ms. Gutierrez is employed as an x-ray technician.

PAST HISTORY

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Musculoskeletal: Right index finger pain.
• Endocrine: Denies diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Very pleasant, healthy appearing, cooperative male in no distress.

Neurological
Grossly intact. Slightly diminished sensation to light touch over the right PIP joint of the index finger compared to the middle finger.

Cardiovascular
Regular rate and rhythm.

Musculoskeletal
Exam of the right hand, there is no swelling or ecchymosis in the palm on the volar surface of his index finger. Normal creases are noted. Index finger rests in a 10 degree PIP joint flexed position with discomfort upon correction. Bilateral extremities 2+ radial pulses.

RESULTS

X-rays today, 4 views of the right hand, show no bony abnormalities. Joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand. No soft tissue shadows of concern. No arthritis.

MRI of the right index finger performed on 04/24/2021. Independent review of the images shows focal soft tissue swelling over the right index MCP joint, partial-thickness tear of the right FDS, and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the FDP and FDS tendons. Radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index MCP joint were intact as was the MCP joint capsule. The extensor tendons were also deemed intact.

ASSESSMENT

• Stenosing tenosynovitis of right index finger.

Ms. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion of his right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in March of this year. The findings of his examination are consistent with rather severe post-traumatic stenosing tenosynovitis.

PLAN

The patient and I had a lengthy discussion regarding his history, symptoms, and radiographic findings. We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of stenosing tenosynovitis and the anatomy of the flexor tendons and pulley system in the hand. I explained to the patient that the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon was clearly intact and that He is suffering from post-traumatic inflammation around the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon blocking excursion of the flexor tendons to the A1 pulley.

Treatment options were discussed including conservative management with corticosteroid injections and their statistical effectiveness. Surgical correction was also briefly discussed, although I recommend exhausting non-operative measures with a minimum of 2 injections before proceeding with surgery. I recommended a right index trigger finger cortisone injection today, and the patient elected to proceed. I also recommend that the patient report to occupational therapy once a week for the next 6 weeks to work on full active and passive right index finger range of motion with no restrictions.

The patient verbalizes understanding with the treatment plan and agrees. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction today.

PROCEDURE

Right index trigger finger injection.
The patient understands the risks and benefits and elected to proceed, signed consent obtained. An attempt was made to inject 1.0 cc of Celestone with 0.5 cc of lidocaine. However, the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle with contortions of the hand and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick. Therefore, the needle was withdrawn. The patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath. We attempted a 2nd time for a similar injection using the same technique with 1.0 cc of Celestone and 0.5 cc of lidocaine. There was a small palmar vein that bled a scant amount, which was cleaned up off the back of the patient's hand. A Band-Aid was applied. He was reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger. I recommended icing it this evening and taking ibuprofen.

[doctor] all right , well , i mean , you know that you need to move that finger , and i think to the degree that they can help you do that . so i want you to move that finger , finger , but i think it would be , uh , beneficial for you to have an accountability , um , so at least you know to check in with them once a week with somebody . [patient] um , okay . that's kinda why i'm here , for you to tell me what needs to be done , you know ? [doctor] yeah , so i'll write you out , um , an outpatient prescription . i think if you go back to the same people where you were before , i'm hoping that after this injection , you're going to be able to do a whole lot more with them . so let's do outpatient once a week for six weeks , um , and then full active and passive range of motion is the goal with no restrictions . [patient] all right , sounds like a plan . [doctor] all right , well , i will have the nurse set up the injection procedure , and we'll , and i'll be back shortly . [patient] thanks , doc .

[doctor] his x-rays , four views of the right hand today , show no bony abnormalities , joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand , no soft tissue shadows of concern , no arthritis . hi , how are you , mr . gutierrez ? [patient] i'm good , how about you ? [doctor] well , how can i help you today ? [patient] so i was a passenger in , uh , a car that was rear-ended , and we were hit multiple times . i felt two bumps , which slung me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger . [doctor] so hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards ? [doctor] okay , so this was march of this year , so maybe about three months ago ? [doctor] mm-hmm . [patient] so i came to see if you could do anything for this hand , because i am right-handed , and i kinda need that hand . [doctor] what do you do for a living ? [patient] uh , i'm an x-ray tech . [doctor] well , um , so do you have any diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis ? [patient] nope . [doctor] uh , do you take any chronic medications of su- , significance ? [patient] uh , i do take a blood pressure pill , and that's it . [doctor] okay , and it looks like you suffer from itching with the methylprednisolone ? [patient] uh , that's correct . [doctor] all right , well , i'm gon na scoot up closer and just take a quick look at your hand . all right , so , lean over here . all right , so on this exam today , we have a very pleasant , cooperative , healthy male , no distress . his heart rate is regular rate , rhythm , 2+ radial pulse , no swelling or bruise , bruising in the palm over the volar surface of his index finger , normal creases , slightly diminished over the pip of the index finger compared to the middle finger . [doctor] his index finger rests in a 10-degree pip-flexed , uh , position . all right , is that uncomfortable to correct that , and is it uncomfortable now here ? [doctor] all right , how about here ? [patient] um , there , it's not . [patient] yeah , it feels , uh , a little numb . [patient] my goodness . it feels like it's , it's tearing in there . [patient] ow , . [patient] well , i've tried . i even bought myself a splint . [doctor] well , but a splint does n't help move you . it actually immobilizes you . [patient] okay . i thought it would straighten it out . [patient] okay . [doctor] uh , now , there's two halves of it . so it's a partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important , and the other one is just fine . [patient] so the good one is good ? [doctor] yes , correct . so the one that goes all the way to the tip is good . [patient] okay , good . [doctor] yeah , so you know , i think what you have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the fds tendon blocking excursion of these other tendons , that they ca n't get through to the pulley . [patient] okay , all right . [doctor] so what i would recommend what we try is a cortisone injection , and i would avoid the dexamethasone , because i saw you have a little reaction to that . but we could use the betamethasone , which is a celestone . [patient] i've gotten another , uh , methylprednisolone , and that itched me like crazy . [doctor] did it ? yeah , this one is water-soluble , and i think it's fairly low toxicity , but high benefit , and i think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that finger . [patient] all right , we'll give it a try . [doctor] good . so , you do the shot , and it's going to take about three to five days before it starts feeling better . and then probably over the next couple of weeks , it'll start feeling even better . [patient] perfect . [doctor] all right , so take advantage of that . you've got ta start moving the finger . you're not going to tear anything or break a bone , uh , because your intensors , extensors are intact . but your collateral ligaments are intact , so you've got a stiff , sore finger . i'm going to try to help as much as i can with this soreness part , and then you have to do all the stiff part . [doctor] hmm . okay , so it was injured , and you had scar tissue . and then , you had post-traumatic inflammation . and so , this will help some with all of that . it's not going to make it to where your finger is like , , my finger does n't hurt at all , but it will make it to where at least tolerable , to where you can make some gains . and we actually might need to repeat this as well . [patient] will i be able to drive ? i drove myself here today , so ... [doctor] yeah , it may feel a little weird , but it's totally safe for you to drive . [patient] okay , good .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Mr. Phillip Gutierrez is a 50-year-old male who presents for a second opinion regarding theIndex finger on the right hand. He had an mri of the same finger obtained from an orthopedic surgeon. The patient was seen at point may by the Physical Therapy staff and a pr, pa at that institution. At present, the patient is not receiving medical care, but is being treated by personnel who are associated with the physical therapy department and the department of PR and pa. Additionally, he is purchasing his own splint, and he has been doing therapy with them. Finally, he was referred to an occupational therapist who was unable to help him with his soreness and inflammation. After further investigation, it was determined that occupational therapy was not helpful and that he needed to see a professional for help. When asked about a possible injection of a1 polyregion ( dexamethasone ) he replied that the injectable was unsafe because it would likely cause his heart to race. Further investigation revealed a partial tear of one ( 1 ) of 2 flexor tendons. This was further resolved with a Cortisone injection using the 1/2 cc of celestone ( 0.5 mg ) and half a cc/hour of lidocaine (0.1 mg/day) on 04/24/2021. Received another methylprednisolone (±6 mg /day), which itched like crazy. Bony abnormalities, joint congruency throughout all lesser digits, no soft tissue shadows of concern. His 4 x-rays, 5 different angles, of which 2 were viewed today. Blood pressure is within normal limits. Hematuria is intact. No swelling or bruise. Palmar vein bled a scant amount. Gastrointestinal: Reports right upper extremity pain. Neurological: Denies numbness, nausea, or vomiting. Heart rate: Normal, 2. Radial pulse: 2+ radial pulses. VITALS  ","CHIEF COMPLAINT  Right index finger pain.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Mr. gutierrez is a 50-year-old male who presents today for a second opinion regarding the Index finger injury. He was a passenger in a motor vehicle accident in march of this year, when he felt two bumps which forced him to move his finger. The patient has been doing therapy with an orthopedicist and a pr,pa at that institution, and is being advised that the Mri was obtained on 4/24/2021, which showed just focal soft tissue swelling over the right index mcp joint, partial-thickness tear of right fdp and fds tendons. A small parma-, uh, palmar vein bled a scant amount, which was cleaned up and band-aid applied. This is consistent with tenosynovitis around the Fdp/DF, as well as lateral to ulnar collateral ligaments of the index “papular” ligament. There is no swelling or bruise, no arthritis. Regarding the pain, the patient states that he has experienced a history of post-traumatic inflammation with the methylprednisolone, but does not want any steroid because of his reaction to dexamethasone. At this time, he did not have an mri due to the concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of ‘F‘ of "" F’ of which he was aware in the past several times that no harm had been done to his fingers. His heart rate is regular rate, rhythm, 2+ radial pulse,ilateralilateral creases,and bilateral radial pilateral finger contortions. Pulp-to-flexed, bilateral bilateral finger with slight numbness and swelling. Endorses an outpatient visit once a week for 6 weeks, with no restrictions. • Musculoskeletal: No bony abnormalities. Respiratory: Denies secondary needle stick. Gen. alice davis ( ph ) provides the following: • Right trigger finger injection template. attempted a similar injection using the same technique with 1 cc of celestone and half a cc OF lidocaine. Failed to obtain anMri of that same template with“ Steriline. ’ • CURRENT MEDICATIONS  • PAST NECK: Regular, active and passive range of motion is the goal • VITALS  ","ASSESSMENT  • Right index finger post-traumatic stenosis. • Reasoning: The patient had a hyperextension injury of the right finger during a motor vehicle accident in march of this year. He has been seen at point may orthopedics largely by the physical therapy staff and a pr, pa at that institution. Today, he was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath.  PLAN  After reviewing the patient's x-rays today, we have a very pleasant, cooperative, healthy male who is a 50-year-old male from los angeles who presents for a second opinion regarding theIndex finger.","ASSESSMENT  • Presented on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger.

CHIEF COMPLAINT  Right index finger hyperextension.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Mr. Phillip Gutierrez is a 50-year-old male who presents for a second opinion regarding theIndex finger on the right hand. He had an mri of the same finger obtained from an orthopedic surgeon. The patient was seen at point may by the Physical Therapy staff and a pr, pa at that institution. At present, the patient is not receiving medical care, but is being treated by personnel who are associated with the physical therapy department and the department of PR and pa. Additionally, he is purchasing his own splint, and he has been doing therapy with them. Finally, he was referred to an occupational therapist who was unable to help him with his soreness and inflammation. After further investigation, it was determined that occupational therapy was not helpful and that he needed to see a professional for help. When asked about a possible injection of a1 polyregion ( dexamethasone ) he replied that the injectable was unsafe because it would likely cause his heart to race. Further investigation revealed a partial tear of one ( 1 ) of 2 flexor tendons. This was further resolved with a Cortisone injection using the 1/2 cc of celestone ( 0.5 mg ) and half a cc/hour of lidocaine (0.1 mg/day) on 04/24/2021. Received another methylprednisolone (±6 mg /day), which itched like crazy. Bony abnormalities, joint congruency throughout all lesser digits, no soft tissue shadows of concern. His 4 x-rays, 5 different angles, of which 2 were viewed today. Blood pressure is within normal limits. Hematuria is intact. No swelling or bruise. Palmar vein bled a scant amount. Gastrointestinal: Reports right upper extremity pain. Neurological: Denies numbness, nausea, or vomiting. Heart rate: Normal, 2. Radial pulse: 2+ radial pulses. VITALS

CHIEF COMPLAINT  Right index finger pain.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Mr. gutierrez is a 50-year-old male who presents today for a second opinion regarding the Index finger injury. He was a passenger in a motor vehicle accident in march of this year, when he felt two bumps which forced him to move his finger. The patient has been doing therapy with an orthopedicist and a pr,pa at that institution, and is being advised that the Mri was obtained on 4/24/2021, which showed just focal soft tissue swelling over the right index mcp joint, partial-thickness tear of right fdp and fds tendons. A small parma-, uh, palmar vein bled a scant amount, which was cleaned up and band-aid applied. This is consistent with tenosynovitis around the Fdp/DF, as well as lateral to ulnar collateral ligaments of the index “papular” ligament. There is no swelling or bruise, no arthritis. Regarding the pain, the patient states that he has experienced a history of post-traumatic inflammation with the methylprednisolone, but does not want any steroid because of his reaction to dexamethasone. At this time, he did not have an mri due to the concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of ‘F‘ of "" F’ of which he was aware in the past several times that no harm had been done to his fingers. His heart rate is regular rate, rhythm, 2+ radial pulse,ilateralilateral creases,and bilateral radial pilateral finger contortions. Pulp-to-flexed, bilateral bilateral finger with slight numbness and swelling. Endorses an outpatient visit once a week for 6 weeks, with no restrictions. • Musculoskeletal: No bony abnormalities. Respiratory: Denies secondary needle stick. Gen. alice davis ( ph ) provides the following: • Right trigger finger injection template. attempted a similar injection using the same technique with 1 cc of celestone and half a cc OF lidocaine. Failed to obtain anMri of that same template with“ Steriline. ’ • CURRENT MEDICATIONS  • PAST NECK: Regular, active and passive range of motion is the goal • VITALS

He is glad to see you. There is no redness on either breast. In terms of her back pain, the patient denies fever, nausea, or vomiting.

[doctor] hi donna ! how are you ?
[patient] i'm good . how about you ?
[doctor] i'm doing well , thank you . and so , i saw that dr. brown put you on buspar . have you been on that before ?
[patient] no , that's new .
[doctor] okay . how is it working for you ?
[patient] my anxiety is going good now , thankfully . i'm serious , it was brutal in november and december . finally , i was like , "" i can not do this . "" i have no idea why it happened . dr. ward did put me on singulair , and she did say we need to be careful because singulair can cause anxiety . so i'm not sure if that was the issue or what .
[doctor] mm . okay .
[patient] and it would , um , start usually during the day , at work .
[doctor] i see .
[patient] i mean , i'm fine now .
[doctor] well , that's good , that things have settled . i do wonder if some of what you are dealing with is hormonal , and that's why i was asking . 'cause you were on the progesterone , and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too .
[patient] i did .
[doctor] and that was before we started the progesterone .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] so i know we started it for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also .
[patient] yeah . and before , in november and december , i noticed that the week before my period , my anxiety would go through the roof . which then , i knew my period was coming . then it turned into my anxiety spiking just at random times .
[doctor] hmm , okay .
[patient] and it seemed like it was for no reason .
[doctor] but november and december you were on the progesterone at that time .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right . so not really a link there , all right .
[patient] yeah , i do n't know .
[doctor] yeah , i do n't know either . um , sometimes with the aging process , that can happen too .
[patient] i figured maybe that's what it was .
[doctor] and we did go through the golive in november and december , so that can be pretty stressful also .
[patient] yeah , and at work , that's when i first started to lead the process of delivering the results to patients with covid . in the beginning of the whole pandemic , patients would have to wait nine days before they'd get their results . and then we opened the evaluation centers and the covid clinic . so i think it just took a toll on me .
[doctor] yeah , i can absolutely see that .
[patient] yeah , and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines . i mean , i was supporting people , sure , but i was n't in the icu . so i felt selfish and guilty . i mean , hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was , having anxiety . and it felt ridiculous .
[doctor] well , honestly , you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so ... but let's see . i need to just put this dax back to work . all right , so no other issues whatsoever ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] have you lost weight ?
[patient] no , but i stopped taking the camila birth control . my hunger level was at a new high . i mean , i was eating constantly . i felt like , "" what is going on ? ""
[doctor] all right .
[patient] and now i am feeling better .
[doctor] okay , that's good . and your masked face , though , it does look thinner .
[patient] well , the past six months i have lost some weight .
[doctor] okay , good . um , anything else going on ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] all right . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative/negative . um , have you ever had an abnormal pap ?
[patient] not with you , but i did around 2009 , and then i had to be seen every six months for a while . and then i had a normal pap .
[doctor] all right , well , let's just repeat it then .
[patient] yeah , that's fine with me , to be safe .
[doctor] okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under , and the potential for getting covid or the vaccine ... i have actually seen some , um , an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while . so that's why i figure let's just check .
[patient] okay . i fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband is n't ready to get it . same with my daughter . she shares the same worries as her dad in how it'll impact her when she gets older .
[doctor] have you had the vaccine ?
[patient] yes , i have . and so has my son . he , um , has had his first already .
[doctor] okay . well , you know , you can only do what you can do .
[patient] yeah , i agree .
[doctor] all right . well , let's complete your exam .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] so let's take a deep breath . and again . all right , you can breathe normally . all right , and take one more deep breath . okay , now i'm gon na touch your neck . go ahead and swallow . perfect . and just place your hand above your head . okay , i do feel some little bumps .
[patient] yeah , but they're not as big as they were .
[doctor] mm-hmm . okay , in this breast it does feel a little bit denser . does it hurt at all ?
[patient] it does , where your left hand just was .
[doctor] okay , right here ?
[patient] yeah , down here . but whenever i breastfed , it was always sore there too . i had a clog and something else . the lumps do feel smaller , but they are still there , unfortunately .
[doctor] yeah , they are . uh , well now i do n't know , because if it was the progesterone , they would've gone away .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right , well just let your knees just op- relax and open . how's the itching or discomfort ? are you still using the cream ?
[patient] yes , and i actually need to get that refilled for the first time ever .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , but yeah , i use it once a week and it does help .
[doctor] okay , great . all right , looks good .
[patient] good .
[doctor] you can go ahead and sit up .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] all right , so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles , and you've had two cycles so far . so i think let's just keep monitoring them for now .
[patient] okay . and what could that mean ?
[doctor] well , so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer , there's also an increased risk for breast issues . you know what i mean ? so for example , cysts and lumps and fibroadenomas , those are all benign things . they're annoying and require some workup , but they're all benign .
[patient] and i'm- i'm just worried because i'm almost 40 and my mom was almost 45 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer . so i mean , i know there's nothing i can do about it , but it's just i feel like , uh , we had it under control and now it is n't .
[doctor] well , i would n't say that . i mean , i feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things , and i think you are more aware of your breasts than ever before , and things actually have n't changed .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so those are all good things .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] because , um , if it was cancer , we'd actually , we would see some change .
[patient] we would ? okay , thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] yeah . so i know it's annoying and distressing , but i think that's where we're at . it's annoying that you have the breast issue , and it's annoying that we have to follow them .
[patient] yeah , i agree there .
[doctor] um , but the only extra that i could po- , uh , potentially do , is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them . and one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam , in the office , to check out it- check it out on their own . uh , they also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier , if they think it needs , um , if they think it needs to be done . and i think they tend to be much quicker than , you know , like radiology as to biopsy it .
[patient] okay . i'll do whatever you think i should .
[doctor] all right . well , i think since you're feeling worried , let's go ahead and we can get them on board . i'll send out a referral and they will call you within the next couple of business days to schedule .
[patient] okay , i think that sounds great .
[doctor] all right . i do too . all right , well any questions or anything else we can discuss today ?
[patient] no , i think i'm all set .
[doctor] all right , good . all right , well have a good rest of your day and just give us a call if you need anything else .
[patient] all right , thank you . you have a good day too .
[doctor] all right .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up bilateral breast cysts.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Donna Torres is a 40-year-old female who presents for follow-up surveillance of bilateral breast cysts.

The patient reports continual presence of “lumps” in bilateral breasts with some soreness. She is being seen today for surveillance of the cysts. The patient is taking progesterone, which was initially prescribed to support normalization of menstruation, which was effective. She is also still using vaginal cream one time per week which has improved symptoms of itching and discomfort.

Her last pap smear was in 2019, with negative/negative results. She did have an abnormal pap smear in 2009, which resulted in repeat pap smears per 6 months until her results normalized.

Mrs. Torres experienced increased anxiety in 11/2021 and 12/2021, stating “it was brutal” and felt she could not manage her symptoms and sought treatment. Dr. Brown started the patient on Buspar, which has successfully controlled her anxiety. The patient relates her anxiety to work related stress and possibly aging. Her work involves supporting Covid evaluation centers and clinics. She confirms receiving both Covid vaccinations. Initially, she was experiencing spikes in anxiety prior to menstruation, but her anxiety then became more random with an unclear cause. To note, the patient was started on Singulair, which the patient was told could also cause anxiety.

The patient discontinued Camila birth control, which did result in a significant increase in appetite. This has resolved and she reports she has lost weight in the past 6 months.

[patient] yeah , and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines . i mean , i was supporting people , sure , but i was n't in the icu . so i felt selfish and guilty . i mean , hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was , having anxiety . and it felt ridiculous . [doctor] well , honestly , you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so ... but let's see . i need to just put this dax back to work . all right , so no other issues whatsoever ? [patient] no . [doctor] have you lost weight ? [patient] no , but i stopped taking the camila birth control . my hunger level was at a new high . i mean , i was eating constantly . i felt like , "" what is going on ? "" [doctor] all right . [patient] and now i am feeling better . [doctor] okay , that's good . and your masked face , though , it does look thinner . [patient] well , the past six months i have lost some weight . [patient] no . [doctor] all right . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative/negative . um , have you ever had an abnormal pap ? [patient] not with you , but i did around 2009 , and then i had to be seen every six months for a while . and then i had a normal pap . [doctor] all right , well , let's just repeat it then . [patient] yeah , that's fine with me , to be safe . [doctor] okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under , and the potential for getting covid or the vaccine ... i have actually seen some , um , an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while . so that's why i figure let's just check . [doctor] have you had the vaccine ? [doctor] okay . well , you know , you can only do what you can do . [doctor] all right . well , let's complete your exam . [patient] all right . [patient] yeah , but they're not as big as they were . [doctor] mm-hmm . okay , in this breast it does feel a little bit denser . does it hurt at all ? [patient] it does , where your left hand just was . [patient] yeah , down here . but whenever i breastfed , it was always sore there too . i had a clog and something else . the lumps do feel smaller , but they are still there , unfortunately . [doctor] yeah , they are . uh , well now i do n't know , because if it was the progesterone , they would've gone away . [patient] yeah . [patient] yes , and i actually need to get that refilled for the first time ever . [doctor] okay . [doctor] okay , great . all right , looks good . [patient] good . [doctor] you can go ahead and sit up . [patient] thank you . [doctor] all right , so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles , and you've had two cycles so far . so i think let's just keep monitoring them for now . [patient] okay . and what could that mean ? [doctor] well , so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer , there's also an increased risk for breast issues . you know what i mean ? so for example , cysts and lumps and fibroadenomas , those are all benign things . they're annoying and require some workup , but they're all benign . [patient] and i'm- i'm just worried because i'm almost 40 and my mom was almost 45 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer . so i mean , i know there's nothing i can do about it , but it's just i feel like , uh , we had it under control and now it is n't . [doctor] well , i would n't say that . i mean , i feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things , and i think you are more aware of your breasts than ever before , and things actually have n't changed . [patient] yeah . [doctor] so those are all good things . [patient] okay . [doctor] because , um , if it was cancer , we'd actually , we would see some change . [patient] we would ? okay , thank you for explaining that . [doctor] yeah . so i know it's annoying and distressing , but i think that's where we're at . it's annoying that you have the breast issue , and it's annoying that we have to follow them . [patient] yeah , i agree there . [doctor] um , but the only extra that i could po- , uh , potentially do , is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them . and one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam , in the office , to check out it- check it out on their own . uh , they also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier , if they think it needs , um , if they think it needs to be done . and i think they tend to be much quicker than , you know , like radiology as to biopsy it . [doctor] all right . well , i think since you're feeling worried , let's go ahead and we can get them on board . i'll send out a referral and they will call you within the next couple of business days to schedule .

[doctor] i'm doing well , thank you . and so , i saw that dr. brown put you on buspar . have you been on that before ? [patient] no , that's new . [doctor] okay . how is it working for you ? [patient] my anxiety is going good now , thankfully . i'm serious , it was brutal in november and december . finally , i was like , "" i can not do this . "" i have no idea why it happened . dr. ward did put me on singulair , and she did say we need to be careful because singulair can cause anxiety . so i'm not sure if that was the issue or what . [doctor] mm . okay . [patient] and it would , um , start usually during the day , at work . [doctor] i see . [patient] i mean , i'm fine now . [doctor] well , that's good , that things have settled . i do wonder if some of what you are dealing with is hormonal , and that's why i was asking . 'cause you were on the progesterone , and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too . [patient] i did . [doctor] and that was before we started the progesterone . [patient] yes . [doctor] so i know we started it for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also . [patient] yeah . and before , in november and december , i noticed that the week before my period , my anxiety would go through the roof . which then , i knew my period was coming . then it turned into my anxiety spiking just at random times . [doctor] hmm , okay . [patient] and it seemed like it was for no reason . [doctor] but november and december you were on the progesterone at that time . [patient] yes . [doctor] all right . so not really a link there , all right . [patient] yeah , i do n't know . [doctor] yeah , i do n't know either . um , sometimes with the aging process , that can happen too . [patient] i figured maybe that's what it was . [doctor] and we did go through the golive in november and december , so that can be pretty stressful also . [patient] yeah , and at work , that's when i first started to lead the process of delivering the results to patients with covid . in the beginning of the whole pandemic , patients would have to wait nine days before they'd get their results . and then we opened the evaluation centers and the covid clinic . so i think it just took a toll on me . [doctor] yeah , i can absolutely see that . [patient] yeah , and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines . i mean , i was supporting people , sure , but i was n't in the icu . so i felt selfish and guilty . i mean , hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was , having anxiety . and it felt ridiculous .

Liver panel revealed an elevated AST at 39 U/L. The ALT, albumin, and total bilirubin were all within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT

Hepatitis C.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's laboratory findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him in regard to his current symptoms. His initial labs were consistent with a hepatitis C diagnosis. I have recommended that we confirm the diagnosis with additional blood work including checking his hepatitis C RNA and HCV genotype. I have also recommended that we obtain an ultrasound elastography to evaluate for fibrosis of the liver.

The patient is married with children and is concerned about their hepatitis C status. I advised the patient that his family should be screened and we will assist him with setting appointments with their primary care physician.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 3 weeks to review his results and discuss further treatment.", [patient] hey bruce so see here my my notes here is you here he had positive lab work for hep c so how're you doing today [doctor] i'm doing okay but i'm a little bit anxious about having hep c i've really surprised because i've been feeling fine they had done it as you know a screen as just part of my physical so i'm really surprised that that came back positive [patient] okay so in the past have any doctors ever told you that you had hep c [patient] okay so just you know i need to ask do you have a history of iv drug use or you know have known any hep c partners [doctor] i mean i used to party a lot and even did use iv drugs but i have been clean for over fifteen years now [patient] okay that that's good i mean i'm i'm happy that you were able to to kick that habit i know a lot of my patients that i see you know they're still dealing with with those dements so i'm i'm i'm happy that you're able to do that so hopefully we can get you better okay [doctor] thank you [patient] so what about alcohol use is that something that you used to do a lot [doctor] i did i did i mean i i still have a beer here and there everyday but not as much as i used to [patient] okay and have you ever smoked before [doctor] i do smoke i smoke about one to two cigarettes per day i've cut down a lot but i'm just having a hard time kicking those less too [doctor] okay [patient] so do you have any other medical conditions [doctor] no i'm actually other than that i just had my physical and i'm not taking any medications no i'm i'm pretty good otherwise [patient] okay and what conditions would you say run in your family [doctor] i have high blood pressure diabetes and depression [patient] okay [doctor] alright so let me go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you so i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good and on general appearance you appear to be in no distress no jaundice on the skin on your heart exam you have a nice regular rhythm rate [patient] regular rate and rhythm with a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur is appreciated on your lung exam your lungs are clear without wheezes rales or rhonchi on your abdominal exam bowel sounds are present your abdomen is soft with no hepatosplenomegaly [doctor] hepatosplenomegaly yes let me i will change that one [patient] splenomegaly and on your muscle exam there is no gait disturbance or edema so i did we i was able to review your your results of your recent lab work and your hcv antibody test was positive so your your liver panel we did one of those and it showed an elevated ast at thirty nine but your alt albumin and total bilirubin were all within normal limits so that's pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you do have hepatitis c so your initial labs were consistent with that hep c diagnosis and so you know i do n't know if you read much about hep c but hepatitis c is a viral infection that does affect your liver and you've most likely had it for several years now it it it most patients do n't see symptoms until years later so the next step that i would like to do is just confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work so that includes checking your hep c rna and your hcv genotype and i would also like to determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver and we will do that by ordering an ultrasound elasto elastography with this information we will we we will be able to know how we can proceed as far as treatment right so how does that sound [doctor] i hmmm so i do have a wife and kids so should i be worried about them [doctor] okay that sounds good [patient] alright [doctor] alright [patient] my

[patient] no i do n't think so
[doctor] alright so we will see you back in a week or two and i'll have my nurse come in with that prescription and hopefully with all the treatment you'll be able to pass the stone okay alright","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Anna Diaz is a pleasant 29-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right-sided back pain.

For approximately 1 week, the patient has been experiencing constant right-sided back pain that radiates down to her lower right side, as well as hematuria and nausea. Her primary care physician was concerned for possible kidney stones and subsequently referred her here for further evaluation. She denies any pain with urination or vomiting, but admits that she has likely not been drinking enough water. The only treatment she has tried so far is ibuprofen with minimal pain relief. Although she denies any personal history of kidney stones prior to this occurrence, she explains that her father has had kidney stones in the past.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Negative for fever.
Gastrointestinal: Positive for nausea. Negative for vomiting.
Genitourinary: Positive for hematuria

VITALS

Vitals are normal.
Blood pressure is normal.
Heart rate is normal.

PHYSICAL EXAM

GI/GU: Mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen. No rebound or guarding. There is CVA located near her flank with tenderness on the right.

RESULTS

CT scan of the abdomen was reviewed today and revealed a kidney stone measuring 0.5 cm in size, located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Kidney stone, right side.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and CT results, I discussed the findings with the patient. The CT scan revealed a 0.5 cm kidney stone in the proximal right ureter. I advised her to drink plenty of fluids, as much as possible, to help facilitate passing of the stone. She was provided with a urine strainer so she can see if and when the stone passes. Given that over-the-counter ibuprofen is not providing significant relief, we will send in a prescription for ibuprofen 800 mg to help with her pain. I'm also going to order a BMP, urinalysis, and a urine culture for further evaluation. Depending on the results of the urinalysis, we may need to start her on antibiotics. I want to see her back in 2 weeks. If she is still symptomatic at that time, we may need to consider further treatment such as a lithotripsy. This procedure was explained to the patient.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow up in 2 weeks.", [doctor] so anna good to see you today so reading here in your appointment notes you were you were diagnosed with kidney stones from your your pcp and you currently have one

and plan so you do have that kidney stone on the right so what i'm recommending is i want you to push fluids just to help facilitate you passing that stone alright have you been taking in have you been drinking enough water do you think so far [patient] probably not enough i drink some but [doctor] okay yeah i i want you to to drink try drink as much as possible just to see if we can get you

work or at home [patient] not really i mean it's basically the same things [doctor] okay yeah i yeah we have a lot of that yes so let me go ahead and and look at this a little closer here the first off i wan na tell you the the vital signs that the my assistant took when you came in your blood pressure is one thirty over sixty eight your heart rate was ninety eight and your respiratory rate was eighteen so those all look good and appear normal and your temperature was ninety seven . seven and that is all normal now when i look at your scalp here i do notice that you have demarcated scaly erythematous plaques and that's just kind of explaining technically what's going on those patches and they're they're in a patchy format they're diffusely present across the back of your skull and that's probably why you you see all that that that white dander you know on your on your your clothes as you go through the day now lem me talk a little bit about my impression and plan i think that you have a scalp psoriasis and let's and here is my thoughts on that what i would like you to use is to use clobetasol that's a zero . zero five percent solution and i want you to use that twice daily on the the affected areas of your scalp so you're just gon na put this on and just kinda gently rub it in now i know to do it twice daily is going to be difficult but if you can do it first thing in the morning when you get up and then before you go to bed you know get a shower and before you go to bed that will be great i want you to continue to use t-gel shampoo that you listed when you first came in that's a very good solution shampoo for that and that will help with controlling a lot of this now there is no cure for this unfortunately and flareups can be unpredictable but we see that you know not a we do n't have a great finger on what causes the flare ups but i'm gon na give you some steroids that will help and we're gon na have to manage that on a ongoing basis but when you get do get a flare up i want you to be using these flare steroid that i give you as we go through that and then i wan na see you back here in three months or sooner if it gets significantly worse do you have any questions for me [patient] no okay so i'll just use that steroid solution and then just as needed if it's really bad but then otherwise just use the t gel [doctor] yeah i want it's exactly what i want you to do i want you to use that that solution twice daily when you get that flare but then other than that just continue to use that t-gel shampoo [patient] alright [doctor] okay i'm gon na have my nurse come in and get you discharged but i the we will see you again in three months or and again please if it gets worse please do n't hesitate to call me and come in sooner [patient] alright

Left foot pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jean Martinez is a pleasant 27-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left foot pain.

The patient sustained an injury to her left foot while playing soccer yesterday. She became entangled with another player, causing the player to fall onto the patient's foot, resulting in immediate pain. After the incident, she required help to get off of the field and was unable to participate for the rest of the game. Her trainer wrapped her foot, and she has tried ice, elevation, and ibuprofen to treat her symptoms. with medication, she rates her pain as 3/10, but without medication her pain is rated as 7-8/10. There is no numbness, tingling, or other abnormal sensations associated with her pain.

Of note, the patient has sustained several injuries in the past while playing soccer, but this is her first left foot injury.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has sustained several soccer injuries in the past.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient has been playing soccer since she was 4 or 5 years old. She is currently playing in a local league.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left foot pain.
Neurological: Denies left foot numbness or tingling.

VITALS

Blood pressure: 118/72 mmHg
Heart rate: 58 bpm
Respiratory rate: 14
Temperature: Afebrile
Oxygen saturation: 99% on room air

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Regular rate and rhythm without clicks, rubs, or murmurs. No ectopic beats noted on auscultation of the heart. Brisk capillary refill, less than 3 seconds. Dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong.
RESPIRATORY: Lungs are clear and equal bilaterally.
NEURO: Motor and sensation in the left foot are intact to light touch.
MSK: Examination of the left foot: Ecchymosis on the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the left foot were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.

ASSESSMENT

Lisfranc fracture, left foot.

PLAN

I explained the nature of her injury in detail. Based on her exam and x-ray findings, she will most likely require surgery of the left foot, but I want to order an MRI to assess for any ligamentous injuries. We discussed the procedure and postoperative expectations, such as recovery time and restrictions, at length. We also discussed the complications associated with deferring surgical intervention including poor bone and ligament healing, pes planus deformation, and a high likelihood of developing arthritis in the foot. She will be unable to participate for the remainder of the soccer season, but should be able to play next season.

INSTRUCTIONS

We will see the patient on Monday, for surgery.", [doctor] hey jean how're you doing today [patient] i'm doing alright aside from this foot pain that i have [doctor] so i see here that you looks like you hurt your left foot here where you were playing soccer can you tell me a little bit more about what happened [patient] yeah so yeah i was playing in a soccer game yesterday and i was trying to

[patient] yeah just like this local town leak i started playing that way and then played all throughout school [doctor] that's [patient] high school teams [doctor] that's awesome so just out of curiosity with the left foot have you experienced anything like numbness or tingling or or any strange sensation [patient] no i have not [doctor] okay now if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good blood pressure was one eighteen over seventy two heart rate was fifty eight respiratory rate was fourteen you are afebrile and you had an o2 saturation of ninety nine percent on room air on your heart exam your regular of rate and rhythm do n't appreciate any clicks rubs or murmurs no ectopic beats noted there on auscultation listening to your lungs lungs are clear and equal bilaterally so you're moving good air i'd like to do a focused foot exam on your left foot so i do see some bruising on the bottom of your foot and on the top of your foot as well now there is associated swelling and i do appreciate tenderness to palpation of your midfoot and you are positive for the piano key test on a neurovascular exam of your left foot you have a brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong and you do have motor and sensation that it's intact to light touch now i would like to do a review of the diagnostic imaging that you had before you came in so i do notice a subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space so lem me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan now for for the first concern of right foot pain your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones at the top of your foot where the metatarsals meet your cuboids now there are ligaments at the top of your foot so i'm gon na be ordering an mri to assess for injury to any of these ligaments now based on your exam and from what i'm seeing on your x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery of that foot now the surgery will place the bones back in their proper position and using plates and screws will hold them there while they heal and this is gon na allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly it is a day surgery and you will be able to go home the same day and then i'm going to have you follow up with me here in the clinic you'll be in a cast and you will need to use crutches and you will not be able to use that left foot for about six to eight weeks now after that six to eight weeks you will gradually start walking on your foot based on how you tolerate it and we'll see how you do at that point so i do believe you're gon na need surgery i i'm recommending this because there are significant complications to your foot if we do not do this poor bone and ligament healing can lead to losing the arch of your foot and you're becoming flat-footed you also have a high likelihood of developing arthritis in that foot so what i'm gon na do unfortunately you'll be out the rest of the season but we are gon na get you fixed up and ready for next season if you're okay with all of this i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you started on

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg once a day to treat the pain and swelling. She was advised to stop taking any anti-inflammatory such as Motrin or Advil. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen her right knee. I have also advised her to continue to use the ACE wrap and wear a right knee brace for a few days. She should continue light walking with her brace on. The patient was advised to stop basketball until she follows up in 7 days.

Regarding her diabetes, she should continue to monitor her blood sugars daily. She should reach out to her primary care physician if she sees an increase in her blood sugars due to loss of activity.

playing basketball and jerry ran into me and the inside of my knee hurts [doctor] okay did you fall to the ground or did you just kinda plant and he pushed and you went one way and your knee did n't [patient] i did fall to the ground [doctor] you did fall to the ground okay and did you land on the kneecap i mean did it hurt a lot were you able to get up and continue on [patient] i landed on my side i was not able to continue on [doctor] okay so you get off the off the court is jerry a good player you just got ta ask that question [patient] not really [doctor] no [patient] he does n't have much game [patient] on the inside [doctor] on the inside of it okay and after the injury did they do anything special for you or you know did you get ice on it right away or try anything [patient] i had ice and an ace wrap [doctor] you had ice and what [patient] an ace wrap [doctor] and an ace wrap okay now how many days ago was this exactly [patient] seven [doctor] seven days ago okay yeah your right knee still looks a little swollen for seven days ago so i'm gon na go ahead and now i also see that you're diabetic and that you take five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day are you still you're still on that medication is that correct [patient] correct [doctor] and do you check your blood sugars every morning at home [patient] every morning [doctor] okay great and since this i'm the reason i'm asking all these questions i'm a little concerned about the inactivity with your your knee pain and you know how diabetes you need to be very you know active and and taking your medicine to keep that under control so you know may wan na continue to follow up with your pcp for that diabetes as we go through here and just watch your blood sugars extra as we go through that now i'm gon na go ahead and examine your your right knee and when i push on the outside does that hurt at all [patient] no [doctor] okay and when i push on this inside where it's a little swollen does that hurt [patient] yes [doctor] yeah okay i'm just gon na ask a question did you hear or feel a pop in your knee when you were doing this [patient] i did not no [doctor] you did not okay okay what are you doing for the pain today [patient] some exercises ice and mobic [doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na continue all of my exam when i go ahead and pull on your knee the first thing i'm looking at is i do see some ecchymosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee and when i push around that knee i can see that there is fluid in the knee a little bit of fluid in the knee we call that effusion so i can appreciate some of that effusion and that could be either fluid or blood at this point from the injury that you had now you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee and that's that's concerning for me when i'm gon na just i just wan na move your knee a little bit it does n't look like when i extend it and flex it that you have a full range of motion does it hurt a lot when i moved it back a little more than normal [patient] yes it hurts [doctor] okay okay yeah so you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee now i'm just gon na sit here and and lay you back and i'm gon na pull on your knee and twist your knee a little bit okay you currently there is a negative varus and valgus stress test that's really important so here's what i'm thinking for that right knee i think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from you know maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground i want you to continue to use an ace wrap i'm gon na give you a right knee brace we're gon na wear that for a few days and then i'm gon na send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee now that x-ray as far as the x-ray results that x-ray that i did it this morning in the office the the bony alignment's in good position i do n't see any evidence of any fractures i do notice the the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid but we're just gon na continue to watch that i'm gon na give you a prescription i'd like you to stop taking any of the nonsteroidals that you're taking the motrin or advil whichever one of those and i'm gon na give you meloxicam fifteen milligrams and i want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling i want you to just continue exercising with the the braces and everything on so if you can you can get out and do some light walking that'll be good and then again for your diabetes like i said just continue to watch those blood sugars daily and if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity just reach out to your primary care physician now do you have any questions for me [patient] when can i play basketball again [doctor] yeah that's a great question i'm gon na ask well my first off i want to see you back here in in seven days you know in a week i want you to make an appointment we're gon na relook at it we're gon na determine if that swelling got any worse and if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an mri of that knee to look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament so that's for for sure for seven days you're not gon na be playing basketball now are you in a ligue or is that just you get like pick up basketball [patient] i just played the wife with fun [doctor] okay okay good that's a great activity like i said i wish i could play now i i also know your your family do n't they own that sports store down right off a main street that sells a lot of sporting equipment [patient] yeah they do [patient] we do let me know and i can get you the hook up [doctor] okay great great so i'll i i will let you know i'll just get on and take a look first but i'm gon na go ahead and get get you discharged i'll have my assistant come in we will get you discharged and like i said we will make an

Left ankle pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Matthew Murphy is a pleasant 20-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left ankle pain. The onset of his pain began 2 days ago, when he stepped off of a curb and landed on his left ankle wrong. He denies hearing a pop at the time of the injury, however, he describes his ankle as feeling extended and stretched. He was able to ambulate back to his house after the incident but with pain. He denies any previous injuries to his left ankle. His pain is localized to the lateral aspect of his left ankle and can be rated at 8 out of 10 without medication. When taking ibuprofen his pain level is 7 out of 10. He states he has also iced and elevated his ankle.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that he has been working from home since the start of COVID-19 and enjoys taking lots of walks.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Patient reports left ankle pain.

VITALS

Vitals are slightly elevated due to pain level but are otherwise stable.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NEURO: Normal strength and sensation bilaterally.
MSK: Examination of the left ankle: Ecchymosis noted over the lateral malleolus. Edema is present. Tenderness to palpation laterally. No joint laxity appreciated. No bony tenderness to palpation of the foot. Capillary refill is brisk at less than 3 seconds bilaterally. Strong dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.

RESULTS

These reveal no fracture or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Left ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his symptoms are consistent with an ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex. The nature of the diagnosis and treatment options were discussed. At this time he will continue to follow the RICE protocol. He will continue to take NSAIDs as needed for pain and swelling. He will also be placed into an Aircast for ankle stabilization and will be provided crutches in order to remain non-weight-bearing. We discussed that it may be a few days before he feels able to tolerate walking. I also advised him that his symptoms will likely start to improve significantly over the next 4 to 6 days.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to assess his progress, sooner if needed.", [doctor] hey matthew how're you doing [doctor] i'm doing pretty good hey i see here in the nurse's notes it looks like you hurt your left ankle can you tell me a little bit more about that [patient] yeah i did my wife and i were on a walk yesterday and i was just talking to her and and stepped off the curb

left ankle since then have you done anything to help make it make the pain less [patient] i have taken some ibuprofen and then i just tried to elevate it and ice it a little bit and keep my weight off of it [doctor] okay so let's talk real quick about your pain level zero being none ten being the worst pain you've been in in your life without any medication on board can you rate your pain for me [patient] i would say it's about an eight [doctor] okay and then when you do take that ibuprofen or tylenol what what's your relief level what's your pain look like then [patient] maybe a seven it it's a little [doctor] okay now you mentioned going for a walk my wife and i've been on on back behind the new rex center where the new trails are have you guys been back there [patient] we have n't yet but i'm sure we'll check it out ever since i feel like working at home during covid we we we take walks all the time [doctor] yeah i [patient] no i have n't been there yet [doctor] yeah those those trails are great there's like five miles of regular flat trails and then there's a bunch of hiking trails that they've opened up as well it's a really great place man you guys need to get out there we'll get you fixed up and we'll get you back out there okay [patient] awesome [doctor] so let's let's talk a little bit about my physical exam if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you your vitals look stable by the way a little elevated i know you're in pain on a focused exam of your left ankle now i do appreciate that there is ecchymosis or bruising over the lateral malleolus and there is some swelling i do i do appreciate some edema now you are positive for tenderness to palpation on the lateral side and the the soft tissue is swollen here the good news is i do not appreciate any laxity in the joint okay and i do n't feel any any type of bony tenderness to palpation of your foot now on the neurovascular exam of your left foot capillary refill is brisk less than three seconds and i do appreciate strong dorsalis pedis pulses and you do have motor and sensation intact which is good now it's important that they were compared bilaterally and they are yeah your your exam is the same bilaterally so that that's an important thing now we did do an x-ray of that left ankle when you came in so i'm gon na review those x-ray results with you now the good news is i do not appreciate a fracture or any bony abnormalities so that's a good thing right so let me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem of your left ankle pain your symptoms are consistent with an ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex and the ligament on the outside of your ankle is what got stretched when you fell now the best treatment for this sprain is what you've kind of already been doing doing the elevation and compression and ice so we're gon na continue the rice protocol and i am gon na go ahead and give you an air cast just to stabilize that ankle i'm gon na prescribe you some crutches i want you to stay off that leg but i do want you to start walking as tolerated but it may be a few days before you feel like doing that now your symptoms are going to get better significantly over the first you know four five six seven days but i am gon na wan na follow up with you just to make sure you're doing okay so what i do is i would like to see you in two weeks and i'm gon na have you continue taking those nsaids as well to help reduce that pain and swelling any other questions comments or concerns before i have the nurse come in and get you fixed up [patient] no i think that sounds like a plan [doctor] okay sounds good like i said i will see you in two weeks if you have any questions or if you have a lot of pain come back in we'll reevaluate otherwise i think you're headed in the right direction and i'll see you again in two weeks [patient] awesome thanks document [doctor] alright thanks

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Matthew Brooks is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a left ankle injury. The onset of his pain began yesterday when he stepped off the curb and landed on it wrong. He reports that he has been complaining of pain for a couple of days.

In terms of treatment, we are going to continue the rice protocol: Elevation, compression, ice. We will also continue taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDS).

Esophagitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Betty Hill is a 53 y.o. female who presents to clinic today for a new patient evaluation of suspected esophagitis. The patient was referred from the emergency department where she was seen in early 10/2020 following 4 days of chest pain. The pain has resolved but she kept this appointment to discuss the original 4-day episode.

The patient describes her chest pain in early 10/2020 as sharp and localized behind the sternum. She states that it felt like a heart attack and the onset was sudden. The pain was exacerbated by eating and accompanied by dysphagia. The patient is not able to say whether she had heartburn as she has never experienced heartburn before and is unsure what it feels like. When asked about potential triggers, the patient identifies that she was experiencing a lot of stress at that time due to a job transition. She was able to tolerate the chest pain and dysphagia for 4 days but reports that nothing she tried relieved her symptoms. She then presented to the emergency department and underwent labs and EKG. All results came back normal from these tests. She was not prescribed any medications in the emergency department but was given a referral to me for suspected esophagitis. Her chest pain and dysphagia resolved spontaneously approximately 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred.

The patient denies unintentional weight loss, weight gain, abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. She states she is trying to lose weight.

PAST HISTORY

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Cardiovascular:  Positive for chest pain.
• Gastrointestinal:  Positive for difficulty swallowing.
• Psychiatric:  Positive for stress.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
Mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants.

RESULTS

The patient’s emergency department records from her 10/2020 visit were reviewed, including the normal cardiac workup.

ASSESSMENT

The patient presents today following a visit to the emergency department in early 10/2020 for 4-days of sharp chest pain, made worse by eating, and dysphagia. Notably, the patient was experiencing higher levels of stress than normal for her at that time due to a job transition. Her cardiac evaluation in the emergency department was normal and she was referred to me for suspected esophagitis. The patient’s pain and associated dysphagia spontaneously resolved 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred. Possible etiologies of her chest pain and dysphagia include GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal etiologies, and anxiety. Based on her history today, I suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition, plus or minus a contribution from musculoskeletal etiologies.

Non-cardiac chest pain.

Suspected etiology of anxiety with or without underlying musculoskeletal etiology.

PLAN

• We discussed the role of an EGD in evaluating her prior symptoms. Given her current asymptomatic status, I am comfortable foregoing the EGD for now in lieu of continued monitoring for symptom recurrence. The patient agreed to notify my office if her symptoms return at which time, we could schedule the EGD. The patient is agreeable to this plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

• Self-monitor for symptom recurrence and notify my office if this occurs.
• Follow up as needed."," [doctor] next is betty hill , uh , date of birth is 2/21/1968 . she has a past medical history of uterine fibroids and anemia . she's a new patient with a referral from the er of esophagitis . um , i reviewed our records from the er , including the normal cardiac workup , and we're about to go in and see her now . good morning . you miss hill ?

[doctor] that sounds good . um , so you can call the office if you have any additional episodes of pain or any other symptoms you're concerned about . if that happens , we'll get you scheduled for an egd to take a look . if not , you can follow up with me ... follow up with me as needed for any other gi complaints . [patient] okay . [doctor] you're welcome . right this way . all right . uh , in assessment , please summarize the patient's history briefly , and let's list her possible etiologies such as , uh , gerd , dyspepsia , esophagitis , musculoskeletal etiologies , and anxiety . uh , suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition , plus or minus a contribution from her musculoskeletal etiologies . um , in the plan , include our discussion of the egd versus monderning ... monitoring for symptom . patient elected to self-monitor her symptoms and will call with any reoccurrence or change . thanks ."," [doctor] next is betty hill , uh , date of birth is 2/21/1968 . she has a past medical history of uterine fibroids and anemia . she's a new patient with a referral from the er of esophagitis . um , i reviewed our records from the er , including the normal cardiac workup , and we're about to go in and see her now . good morning . you miss hill ? [patient] good morning . yes . that's me . [doctor] hey , i'm dr. sanders . it's nice to meet you . [patient] nice to meet you too . [doctor] so tell me about what brings you in today ? [patient] well , i really needed to see you three months ... three months ago , but this was your first available appointment . when i called to make the appointment , i was having chest pains , but it stopped after four days , and i have n't had any since then . [doctor] okay . when did these four days of chest pain occur ? [patient] um , early october . [doctor] of 2020 , correct ? [patient] yes . [doctor] okay . can you think of anything that might have caused the chest pain ? did you wake up with it ? [patient] no . it just it randomly . i tolerated it for four days but then had to go to the emergency room because nothing i did relieved it . they did a bunch of testing and did n't find anything . [doctor] okay . can you point to the area of your chest where the pain was located ? [patient] well , it was here in the center of my chest , right behind my breastbone . it felt like i was having a heart attack . the pain was really sharp . [doctor] did they prescribe you any medications in the er ? [patient] no . they ran an ekg and did blood tests , but like i said , everything was normal . [doctor] okay . i see . [patient] they thought it was something to do with the gi system , so that's why they referred me here . [doctor] interesting . uh , do you remember having any heartburn or indigestion at , at the time ? [patient] uh , maybe . i do n't think i've ever had heartburn , so i'm not sure what that feels like . [doctor] was the pain worse with eating or exercise ? [patient] yes . with eating . [doctor] okay . any difficulty swallowing ? [patient] mm-hmm . i did . [doctor] okay . and that's also resolved since the initial episode three months ago ? [patient] yes . thankfully . the chest pain and swallowing problem got better about three days after i went to the er . but i just feel like there's something wrong . [doctor] okay . so how has your weight been . [patient] i've been trying to lose weight . [doctor] that's good . any in- ... issues with abdominal pain ? [patient] uh , no . [doctor] okay . good . and how about your bowel movements ; are they okay ? [patient] they're normal . [patient] i do n't think so . [doctor] have had you had any surgeries on your abdomen , or gall bladder , or appendix ? [patient] yes . they took my gall bladder out several years ago . [doctor] okay . if you wan na lay down here on the table for me and lets take a look at you . [patient] okay . [doctor] so when i push on your lower belly , do you have any pain , or does it feel tender ? [patient] no . [doctor] okay . how about up here in your upper abdomen ? [patient] yes . it , it hurts a little . [doctor] okay . and even when i press lightly like this ? [patient] yes . uh , just a little uncomfortable . [doctor] okay . does it hurt more when i press over here on the left or over here on the right ? or is it about the same ? [patient] i'd say it's about the same . [doctor] okay . so we'll say you have some mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants , but everything on your exam looks normal and looks good . [patient] okay . good . [doctor] so let's talk about your symptoms real quick . obviously , with the chest discomfort , we worry about heart issues , but i'm reassured that those were ruled out with all the testing they did in the er . um , other potential causes could be anxiety , esophagitis , which is irritation of the esophagus . but typically with these , um ... but typically , these cause the pain that would last for a long time rather than that isolated incident like you had . um , it's also possible that you had intense heartburn for a few days . [patient] well , since you mention anxiety , i was going through a really stressful job transition right around the time this happened . [doctor] okay . that's good to know . so stress from this could be , um ... could be , uh ... could be very well have contributed to your condition . [patient] okay . [doctor] so we could do an , uh , egd or upper endoscopy to take a look at your esophagus and stomach . this would allow us to look for esophagitis . but your symptoms occurred three months ago and you have n't had any additional episodes , so likely if it were esophagitis , it's already healed by the point ... by this point , and we would n't be able to see anything . the other option is just to continue to monitor , uh , for any additional symptoms at which point we could do the egd . uh , with you being asymptomatic for so long right now , i'm comfortable with that option . but what do you think ?

[patient] okay . [doctor] all right ? if you do n't have any questions for me , i'll walk you out to the check-out desk . [patient] no . that's it . thank you . [doctor] you're welcome . right this way . all right . uh , in assessment , please summarize the patient's history briefly , and let's list her possible etiologies such as , uh , gerd , dyspepsia , esophagitis , musculoskeletal etiologies , and anxiety . uh , suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition , plus or minus a contribution from her musculoskeletal etiologies . um , in the plan , include our discussion of the egd versus monderning ... monitoring for symptom . patient elected to self-monitor her symptoms and will call with any reoccurrence or change . thanks .","CHIEF COMPLAINT  Esophagitis.

[doctor] and audiology too , right ?
[patient_guest] yes .
[doctor] yeah , wow. .
[patient_guest] yeah , it has definitely been a whirlwind of stuff . when we saw the geneticist , she told us that sometimes people with this syndrome , they have trouble with their kidneys . that they might actually fuse into one . she also said sometimes they have problems with their legs , so that was why we saw ortho .
[doctor] okay . okay .
[patient_guest] so we have seen everybody , really . we are just here to make sure that her kidneys are looking good right now .

[doctor] sure , yeah .
[patient_guest] so i give her that milk , water now that she's used to it , and sometimes water with just a little bit of juice . so i do feel like she's drinking a lot better now .

Renal screening tests.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Katherine Lopez is a 22-month-old female, born at 34 weeks +3 days gestation, diagnosed with the rare Smith-Magenis syndrome and associated global developmental delays. She was referred to nephrology by genetics who recommended renal screening tests. At birth, the patient weighed 4 pounds 8 ounces, exhibited difficulties during eating where she would stop breathing, and challenges regulating her body temperature; determined to be typical issues associated with premature birth. The patient has seen many specialists, including GI for severe reflux, a dietitian who recommended discontinuing consumption of cow’s milk, and a neurologist who diagnosed her with Smith-Magenis syndrome. Additionally, she has been seen by a geneticist, orthopedist, ophthalmologist, and audiologist. The patient is not ambulatory, did not sit up unassisted until 1 years old, and is currently crawling and attempting to take steps. She will be starting speech therapy in the next few weeks, and currently she is in occupational, feeding, and physical therapy. The geneticist informed the patient's mother that patients with Smith-Magenis syndrome usually have kidney issues where “the kidneys fuse into one” and issues with their legs.

The patient has approximately 8 to 10 wet diapers in a 24-hour period. Her mother notes that she is doing better with drinking fluids and she urinates “a lot”. The patient drinks Ripple Pea Protein milk instead of cow’s milk, water and water mixed with a small amount of juice. Her twin sister is approximately the same size, and their weight is essentially the same, she is healthy, and the mom denies any known health concerns or diagnoses. The mom states that Katherine is shorter and seems chubbier related to her syndrome. She also has a 9-year-old brother who is diagnosed with autism.

[patient_guest] and when the twins were born , katherine , she was about 4 pounds , 8 ounces . and her twin was a bit smaller , at 3 pounds , 13 ounces . [patient_guest] katherine , she was doing fine . she just had problems with eating , where she would stop breathing when she was eating . [doctor] like preemie type stuff ? [patient_guest] uh- . yeah . she just had a hard time regulating her temperature , but she did fine . she does have a gi doctor , because she has reflex really bad . she also had a dietician , who told us to take her off cow's milk . which we did . and then she has seen an allergist , and also a neurologist ... who diagnosed her with this syndrome , because she still does n't walk and she was n't sitting by herself a year old . [doctor] yeah . [patient_guest] but so now she is crawling and she is trying to take steps , so think she's doing pretty good . [doctor] awesome . okay . [patient_guest] and we also have speech therapy , who is going to be starting within the next couple of weeks . [doctor] that's great . [patient_guest] so , she has a lot of therapies . we have also seen an orthopedic and an ophthalmologist . i can never say that . we have seen everything , really . [doctor] and audiology too , right ? [patient_guest] yes . [doctor] yeah , wow. . [patient_guest] yeah , it has definitely been a whirlwind of stuff . when we saw the geneticist , she told us that sometimes people with this syndrome , they have trouble with their kidneys . that they might actually fuse into one . she also said sometimes they have problems with their legs , so that was why we saw ortho . [doctor] okay . okay . [patient_guest] so we have seen everybody , really . we are just here to make sure that her kidneys are looking good right now . [doctor] yeah , okay . so , um , tell me about how many wet diapers she has in a 24 hour period ? [patient_guest] she has a lot . [doctor] so like normal 8 to 10 , or like 20 ?

She was about a pound smaller than her twin when they were born, 3 weeks ago. The family has seen an allergist, who told them to take her off cow's milk. They did and she is doing very well. At the same time, she has a Geneticist who diagnosed her with the syndrome, because she still does not walk and wasn't sitting by herself a year old. However, her attempts to sit and stand have been delayed due to her symptoms of vertigo. Her twin also has autism. He is 9 years old and he is the older of the two twins. Both of them are well-nourished and able to wear the other twin's clothes. Katherine has been taking milk off dairy milk for a while, but she used to only drink milk and then she took it off until she was almost exclusively lactose-free. This has caused her to have some wet diapers in a 24 hour period, which she estimates to be around 8 to 10.

aci,D2N082,"[doctor] alright
[patient] you're ready just
[doctor] ready
[patient] hi kyle how are you today
[doctor] i'm doing well i'm just anxious about my pcp told me that i had some abnormal lab work and why she wanted me to be seen by you today
[patient] yeah i bet that did make you nervous i i see that she referred you for a low immunoglobulin a level is that your understanding
[doctor] yeah i mean i do n't even really understand what that means but yeah that's what she told me
[patient] yeah that's a mouthful
[doctor] yeah
[patient] it it's the the one of the antibodies in your body and that that really makes that your body makes to fight infections it's a little bit low i'm happy to explain it a little bit more to you i just have a few more questions okay so let's start again here
[doctor] i'll do this
[patient] i i think i would break that
[doctor] yeah i just saw that
[patient] if you can do that
[doctor] okay
[patient] yeah so we'll we'll just
[doctor] okay
[patient] you can leave it the way it is for now i just i think break that up
[doctor] okay alright so yeah that sounds fine for me
[patient] yeah i do you know why she checked these levels in the first place that you've been having problems getting frequent infections
[doctor] yeah yeah i had a recent physical and she did this as part of her my physical i do tend to get infections but i do n't know i i'm so used to it so i do n't know if this is more than usual in the wintertime i get a lot of colds and they do seem to i always say that my colds kind of linger for a long time but i do n't know if it's more than usual
[patient] okay how about any abdominal infections
[doctor] diarrhea no
[patient] frequently
[doctor] no not that i can not that i say can think of
[patient] okay what about your family are are anyone in your family that you know have immune deficiencies
[doctor] no my family is actually pretty healthy
[patient] okay and how about do you have any other medical conditions
[doctor] yeah my pcp just started me on metformin i just got diagnosed with type two diabetes
[patient] okay okay yeah diabetes your family your family owns that donut shop right i mean down at the end of the street
[doctor] yes and that's probably part of the cause of my diabetes yes
[patient] yeah well i guess you're gon na have to watch that
[doctor] i know i know
[patient] but you know everything in moderation i mean just you know you just need to be careful you ca n't does n't have to go away
[doctor] right
[patient] but have you ever needed to receive a blood transfusion or blood products
[doctor] no i actually tried to give blood but they i did n't qualify because i had recently traveled internationally
[patient] okay where did you go
[doctor] i was in zambia
[patient] hmmm i heard that's beautiful
[doctor] it's so beautiful it's so beautiful i had a great time
[patient] okay well let me let me go ahead and do a physical examination here i reviewed your vitals you know that the the assistants collected when you first came in including your weight and everything looks good there there is no fever there there is nothing that i'm concerned about there now on your heart exam you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any murmurs that's kind of those extra sounds that i would hear and that that all sounds good on lungs lung exam your lungs are clear there's no wheezes rales or rhonchi now on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymph lymphadenopathy swollen lymph glands and then let me just go ahead and i wan na press on your belly a little bit is that tender anywhere that i press it does n't seem like you making any facial
[doctor] no
[patient] no okay so your you know your abdominal exam is your belly is soft there is no tenderness as i i push around there now i did review the results of your recent lab work and it is consistent as as your pcp noted with an iga deficiency that's that immunoglobulin a that we talked about so let me tell you a little bit about the assessment and plan so for your first problem the that a iga deficiency is it very common immunodeficiency your your body makes many different types of antibodies in one of your z iga is just a little bit lower than normal now most of the time people live their entire life without even knowing they have that deficiency and function perfectly normal now some people may find that they get tend to get frequent respiratory tract or sinus or abdominal infections but this does n't necessarily seem to be the case for you now it can go along with other immunodeficiencies but i think there is a low likelihood hood in your case but we're gon na order some additional blood work that includes checking those other antibodies now do you have any questions on what i just told you
[doctor] yeah so is there anything i need to do or should be watching for or should i be worried
[patient] no i i really do n't think you need to be worried now we're gon na check these additional studies and that will give us some more guidance but really i think this is just a finding that's common to you and you know it it's many people have have have these type of you know immunodeficiency what i want you to watch for is those infections that do n't stop you have trouble getting it under control or you know any changes to your abdominal tract you know severe diarrhea
[doctor] anything like that then you know we may want to look at it a little bit further but for now i do n't think there is anything significant we want to do now go ahead and get your lab work and
[patient] bring you in for that now the only other thing that i would say is if you eat end up needing any blood products between now and when i see you next make sure you tell them that you have that iga deficiency
[doctor] why is that
[patient] well there is a risk that your body can strongly react to some blood products and they just need to know that so they're prepared so anytime you get blood just make sure you say that you have a history of a an an iga deficiency
[doctor] okay okay thank you
[patient] you're welcome
[doctor] okay","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Kyle Lee is a pleasant 46-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of low immunoglobulin A level.

ASSESSMENT

IgA deficiency.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that the results of his recent lab work is consistent with an IgA deficiency. I have recommended that we obtain additional blood work to check his other antibodies. I encouraged the patient to be aware of lingering infections or abdominal changes including diarrhea. If he experiences these issues, he should report them to my office so we may investigate further, however I do not believe there is a need for that at this time. In the meantime, he should report this IgA deficiency in the event that he needs any blood transfusions. Questions were invited and answered today.", [doctor] alright [patient] you're ready just [doctor] ready [patient] hi kyle how are you today [doctor] i'm doing well i'm just anxious about my pcp told me that i had some abnormal lab work and why she wanted me to be seen by you today [patient] yeah i bet that did make you nervous i i see that she referred you for a low immunoglobulin a level is that your understanding [doctor] yeah i mean i do n't even really understand what that means but yeah that's what she told me [patient] yeah that's a mouthful [doctor] yeah [patient] it it's the the one of the antibodies in your body and that that really makes that your body makes to fight infections it's a little bit low i'm happy to explain it a little bit more to you i just have a few more questions okay so let's start again here [doctor] i'll do this [patient] i i think i would break that [doctor] yeah i just saw that [patient] if you can do that [doctor] okay [patient] yeah so we'll we'll just [doctor] okay [doctor] okay alright so yeah that sounds fine for me [doctor] yeah yeah i had a recent physical and she did this as part of her my physical i do tend to get infections but i do n't know i i'm so used to it so i do n't know if this is more than usual in the wintertime i get a lot of colds and they do seem to i always say that my colds kind of linger for a long time but i do n't know if it's more than usual [doctor] diarrhea no [patient] frequently [patient] okay what about your family are are anyone in your family that you know have immune deficiencies [doctor] no my family is actually pretty healthy [patient] okay and how about do you have any other medical conditions [doctor] yeah my pcp just started me on metformin i just got diagnosed with type two diabetes [patient] okay okay yeah diabetes your family your family owns that donut shop right i mean down at the end of the street [doctor] yes and that's probably part of the cause of my diabetes yes [doctor] i know i know [patient] but you know everything in moderation i mean just you know you just need to be careful you ca n't does n't have to go away [doctor] right [patient] but have you ever needed to receive a blood transfusion or blood products [doctor] no i actually tried to give blood but they i did n't qualify because i had recently traveled internationally [patient] okay where did you go [doctor] i was in zambia [patient] hmmm i heard that's beautiful [doctor] it's so beautiful it's so beautiful i had a great time [patient] okay well let me let me go ahead and do a physical examination here i reviewed your vitals you know that the the assistants collected when you first came in including your weight and everything looks good there there is no fever there there is nothing that i'm concerned about there now on your heart exam you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any murmurs that's kind of those extra sounds that i would hear and that that all sounds good on lungs lung exam your lungs are clear there's no wheezes rales or rhonchi now on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymph lymphadenopathy swollen lymph glands and then let me just go ahead and i wan na press on your belly a little bit is that tender anywhere that i press it does n't seem like you making any facial [doctor] no [patient] no okay so your you know your abdominal exam is your belly is soft there is no tenderness as i i push around there now i did review the results of your recent lab work and it is consistent as as your pcp noted with an iga deficiency that's that immunoglobulin a that we talked about so let me tell you a little bit about the assessment and plan so for your first problem the that a iga deficiency is it very common immunodeficiency your your body makes many different types of antibodies in one of your z iga is just a little bit lower than normal now most of the time people live their entire life without even knowing they have that deficiency and function perfectly normal now some people may find that they get tend to get frequent respiratory tract or sinus or abdominal infections but this does n't necessarily seem to be the case for you now it can go along with other immunodeficiencies but i think there is a low likelihood hood in your case but we're gon na order some additional blood work that includes checking those other antibodies now do you have any questions on what i just told you [patient] no i i really do n't think you need to be worried now we're gon na check these additional studies and that will give us some more guidance but really i think this is just a finding that's common to you and you know it it's many people have have have these type of you know immunodeficiency what i want you to watch for is those infections that do n't stop you have trouble getting it under control or you know any changes to your abdominal tract you know severe diarrhea [doctor] anything like that then you know we may want to look at it a little bit further but for now i do n't think there is anything significant we want to do now go ahead and get your lab work and [patient] bring you in for that now the only other thing that i would say is if you eat end up needing any blood products between now and when i see you next make sure you tell them that you have that iga deficiency [doctor] why is that [patient] well there is a risk that your body can strongly react to some blood products and they just need to know that so they're prepared so anytime you get blood just make sure you say that you have a history of a an an iga deficiency [doctor] okay okay thank you [patient] you're welcome [doctor] okay, [doctor] alright [patient] you're ready just [doctor] ready [patient] hi kyle how are you today [doctor] i'm doing well i'm just anxious about my pcp told me that i had some abnormal lab work and why she wanted me to be seen by you today [patient] yeah i bet that did make you nervous i i see that she

mouthful [doctor] yeah [doctor] i'll do this [patient] i i think i would break that [doctor] yeah i just saw that [patient] if you can do that [doctor] okay [patient] yeah so we'll we'll just [doctor] okay [patient] yeah i do you know why she checked these levels in the first place that you've been having problems getting frequent infections [doctor] yeah yeah i had a recent physical and she did this as part of her my physical i do tend to get infections but i do n't know i i'm so used to it so i do n't know if this is more than usual in the wintertime i get a lot of colds and they do seem to i always say that my colds kind of linger for a long time but i do n't know if it's more than usual [patient] okay how about any abdominal infections [doctor] diarrhea no [patient] frequently [doctor] no not that i can not that i say can think of [doctor] no my family is actually pretty healthy [patient] okay and how about do you have any other medical conditions [doctor] yeah my pcp just started me on metformin i just got diagnosed with type two diabetes [patient] okay okay yeah diabetes your family your family owns that donut shop right i mean down at the end of the street [doctor] yes and that's probably part of the cause of my diabetes yes [patient] yeah well i guess you're gon na have to watch that [doctor] i know i know [patient] but you know everything in moderation i mean just you
