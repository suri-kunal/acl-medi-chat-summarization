Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

James Allen is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure and type 2 diabetes, who presents today with back pain.

The patient states he was golfing and hurt his back. This happened approximately 4 days ago when he felt a pop in his back. The patient notes that he immediately hit the ground trying to loosen up his back. He reports taking some Tylenol, ibuprofen, and using ice and heat which did not relieve the pain. By Monday morning it loosened up a little bit, but it is still pretty sore. He had some right lower extremity weakness and some drop foot that he felt that for a while, and it got a little better this morning but not much. He had surgery about 10 years ago in his lower back.

Regarding his congestive heart failure, he has been watching his diet and trying to exercise regularly. He is avoiding the salty foods and has been compliant with medications. He has gained a little weight over the summer but nothing more than 5 pounds. He has no problems lying flat to go to bed.

Regarding his diabetes, he is watching his blood sugars at home, not always consistently. He is still on his metformin.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

James Allen is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure and type 2 diabetes, who presents today with back pain.

Acute lumbar strain.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient reports feeling a 'pop' and immediate pain while golfing approximately 4 days ago. He has tried Tylenol and ibuprofen without significant relief.
• Additional Testing: If he continues to have pain, we will obtain an MRI for further evaluation.
• Medical Treatment: Initiate meloxicam 15 mg once daily.
• Specialist Referrals: We will refer him to physical therapy to work on strengthening the area.

Diabetes type 2.
• Medical Reasoning: He has been compliant with metformin and dietary modifications, but his recent hemoglobin A1c was 8.
• Additional Testing: Repeat hemoglobin A1c in a couple of months.
• Medical Treatment: Increase metformin to 1000 mg twice daily.

Congestive heart failure.
• Medical Reasoning: He is doing well from this standpoint. He has been compliant with his medications, dietary modifications, and regular physical activity.
• Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg once daily and Lasix. Lisinopril was refilled today.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Bryan Smith is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history significant for and prior discectomy, who presents with back pain.

The patient reports he felt something in the lower right side of his back while pushing a refrigerator up through another room. This happened about 5 days ago. The patient experiences pain while bending over. He has a history of a discectomy. He is worried that something happened. He has been taking ibuprofen, which has not been beneficial alone. With the combination of Tylenol and ibuprofen, he experiences symptomatic relief. He denies numbness and tingling in his legs, and any problems with his bladder or bowels.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain or dyspnea on exertion.
• Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.
• Gastrointestinal: Denies hematemesis, hematochezia, melena, heartburn, or abdominal pain.
• Genitourinary: Denies urinary urgency, pain, or incontinence.
• Musculoskeletal: Endorses lower right side back pain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
• Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No extra heart sounds.
• Musculoskeletal: Pain to palpation to the right lumbar spine and the paraspinal muscles. Decreased flexion and extension of the back. Positive straight leg raise on the right. Strength is good bilaterally in the lower extremities.

RESULTS

X-ray of the lumbar spine is unremarkable. Normal bony alignment. No fractures were noted.

Labs: Within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Bryan Smith is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history significant for prior discectomy, who presents with back pain.

Lumbar strain.
• Medical Reasoning: He reports right-sided low back after moving a refrigerator approximately 5 days ago. X-ray of his lumbar spine is unremarkable. I do not believe this is related to his previous discectomy.
• Additional Testing: We will order a MRI of the lumbar spine for further evaluation.
• Medical Treatment: Initiate meloxicam 15 mg once daily, as well as Ultram 50 mg every 4 hours as needed.
• Specialist Referrals: We will refer him to physical therapy to be started after we get his MRI results back.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to discontinue the use of ibuprofen, but he may continue using Tylenol if he wishes.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."," [doctor] hi , bryan . how are you ? [patient] i'm doing well . i'm a little sore .

Follow-up from an emergency room visit.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Louis Williams is a 58-year-old male presenting for a follow-up from an emergency room visit.

The patient states that he was playing tennis on Saturday, that he was really hot and that after approximately 30 minutes he was struggling to breathe. He states that he thought he was having a heart attack at that time. His wife took him to the emergency room and at that time, he states that he had been feeling very lightheaded and dizzy. He notes that on Sunday he felt fine.

The patient reports that he has been very diligent with his medications for his congestive heart failure. He notes that he has been avoiding salt for the most part but there has been some dietary indiscretion more recently.

He is status post cataract extraction approximately 3 months ago, and notes that everything has been fine since then. He denies any vision problems at this time.

The patient had a skin cancer removed approximately 5 months ago. He reports this is well healed.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Cardiovascular: Endorse dyspnea on exertion.
• Respiratory: Endorses shortness of breath.
• Neurological: Endorses lightheadedness and dizziness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Neck: Supple. No jugular venous distention.
• Respiratory: Fine crackles bilaterally.
• Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs. Bilateral lower extremity edema.

RESULTS

ECG revealed left ventricular hypertrophy consistent with congestive heart failure.
Echocardiogram demonstrates stable diminished ejection fraction.
Skin cancer pathology demonstrates clear margins.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 58-year-old male who presents for follow-up after emergency room visit.

ED follow-up and congestive heart failure.
• Medical Reasoning: I believe his symptoms which led to his ED visit were due to an exacerbation of his heart failure. He admits to some dietary indiscretion, which likely resulted in fluid retention.
• Medical Treatment: I will prescribe Lasix 80 mg once a day. I will also place him on carvedilol 25 mg twice a day.

Status post basal cell carcinoma removal.
• Medical Reasoning: He seems to be doing well and the removal site is well-healed. No change in treatment is necessary at this time.

Status post cataract surgery.
• Medical Reasoning: He seems to be doing well. We will continue to observe, but no treatment changes are needed today.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment.

Right upper arm pain.

HPI:

Ms. Russell is a 39-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of severe right upper arm pain. She states she was playing volleyball yesterday and fell and landed on her arm. She has been taking ibuprofen every 6 hours but it does not help. She rates her pain 9/10. She denies any numbness or tingling in her arm. She has a history of gallstones and takes Pepcid. She has a past surgical history of a lumbar fusion 6 years ago. She denies any allergies.

EXAM

Examination of the right upper extremity shows swelling and erythema of the right shoulder. Tenderness over the right shoulder. Normal pulses.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right humerus, 2 views, obtained on today's visit show a proximal humerus fracture.

IMPRESSION

Right proximal humerus fracture.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended we place her into a long arm cast and sling. She will follow up in 2 weeks for repeat imaging. At that point, we may need to discuss surigical options. I will prescribe Lortab, 5 mg, #20 (twenty) to take every 6 hours as needed for pain.

virtscribe,D2N025,"[doctor] next patient is nicole miller . date of birth is 09/18/1949 . patient was called for a follow-up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction . bmp's been , uh , 3,000 in march , and is about six- was up to 6,000 in april . she was increasingly dyspneic . we changed her furosemide and torsemide 20 milligrams by mouth daily . uh to note , the patient is not currently on potassium supplement . her lisinopril had- has also been increased up to 10 milligrams daily in march . also did when i saw her last april . she reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at east metro . it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status before surgery .
[doctor] hey , miss miller , how are you today ?
[patient] i'm doing okay , thank you .
[doctor] i asked you to come in today because we want to keep- we want you to have this knee surgery this summer but we want to keep a close eye on you to make sure a week before your surgery you do n't suddenly go into congestive heart failure and it gets postponed .
[patient] yeah , that would not be good .
[doctor] i see you're scheduled on the 24th for surgery .
[patient] yeah , that's right .
[doctor] okay , good . well it looks like you have lost about 3 , 3 and a half pounds since i saw you last in april . some of that might be water weight , but still , this is positive .
[patient] yeah , i noticed that too . i think the oxyglutinine is helping as well . my urgency to use the bathroom is much better .
[doctor] well that's great .
[patient] yeah , i , i'm pleased about it too .
[doctor] you ever get leg or finger cramps or anything like that ?
[patient] yeah , i had leg cramps the other day , but i thought it might , was maybe just because i was cold as i had my ceiling fan on and fell asleep . i had cramps when i woke up in both legs right here . um i drank pickle juice and it went right away .
[doctor] well do n't , do n't get crazy with the pickle juice because all of the salt in it .
[patient] haha , i know , i only drink about 4 ounces or so .
[doctor] okay good .
[patient] um it went away so i did n't drink anymore . i find it works a lot better than trying to put some cream on my leg .
[doctor] sure just , just keep it in moderation .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then are you still on an iron supplement ? and are you using the bathroom okay ?
[patient] uh yes , everything is good .
[doctor] good . how is your heart burn doing ? any problems with that ?
[patient] no , it did get bad for a while so i tried to take some prilosec and then stopped that other one .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] um i did that for like , gosh , i think it was two weeks back in january and have n't had any problems since .
[doctor] great .
[patient] um and after i stopped taking that um i went back to the stomach one , so i'm doing good now .
[doctor] okay and you're still due for a colonoscopy , correct ?
[patient] uh yeah , that's right .
[doctor] all right , let's review your blood work real quick . i checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past but that is still doing great .
[patient] good , that's a relief to hear .
[doctor] your potassium is 3.9 so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was .7 not .8 so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your bun may be a tiny bit elevated at 23 which is the number we look for for dehydration sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . um so when i look at your numbers as a whole i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number- i sent to look at your heart failure number . there is a test called a bmp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3,000 and then went up to 6,000 in april before i made the change . i'm still waiting for those results .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all in all i think you're doing good on paper though .
[patient] what about , um what's it called , a1c ? does that show up ?
[doctor] um i do n't think i ordered it but i could . your last a1c was 5.5 in march .
[patient] all righty .
[doctor] so your blood sugar is a little bit high , it was 169 today but that kind of depends on what you ate and you were n't fasting for the blood check so i might have to repeat that test for pre-op , but i do n't think we need to do it today .
[patient] all righty that sounds good .
[doctor] i checked your magnesium level because sometimes you uh urinate out magnesium with the water pills but it was normal at 1.7 and your blood pressure is also looking good .
[patient] okay great . that all sounds awesome .
[doctor] all right let's take a quick listen .
[doctor] use my general physical exam template .
[doctor] and take a couple of deep breaths for me .
[doctor] your lungs sound pretty good to me so keep doing what you're doing . um uh , like i said , i think you're doing good overall but let's just talk about a few things .
[patient] all righty .
[doctor] so we often like to keep people with heart problems on magnesium and get their levels up to around the 2-ish range . yours is a little bit less than 2 and we want that 2-ish range because it can help stabilize the heart muscle . so i might recommend putting you on magnesium supplement . it's supposed to be twice a day so that's kind of annoying , but i know you're on other medicines twice a day too , so i think you'll do fine .
[patient] yeah , that'll be okay .
[doctor] great . now before surgery we'll have to get you off your clopidogrel for a week beforehand .
[patient] yes , okay , i have everything written down on my phone , and i have a letter taped to the side of my bed to remind me .
[doctor] perfect ! we will give you a reminder as well . we will also need to complete a pre-op check within two weeks of your surgery during the first or second week of june .
[patient] okay , i'll put that down .
[doctor] you might also have to repeat an ekg before surgery which we could do today . i know i'm sure it feels like you're doing , you're always doing ekgs . um we do n't need to any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently , and we do n't need any more blood work because we did that today .
[patient] yeah , i do a lot of ekgs . i'm basically a regular . but i'm happy to do one today , no problem .
[doctor] lastly , once we get your knee surgery , um we , we should think about getting you a colonoscopy . we can do it here locally because you have medicare . do you have private insurance also ?
[patient] yeah , i have both .
[doctor] okay so yes , you can get it , your colonoscopy , wherever you'd like .
[patient] okay , well my husband's insurance may be running out . might we be able to get the procedure done sooner ? maybe in the next 30 days ? is that okay ?
[doctor] um i can put it in right now for , uh , for county for the next 30 days , and they might be able to get you in within the next few weeks . it should not take , it should not make you ineligible for the surgery . in other words completing a colonoscopy would not delay your surgery .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so let me see . i've been doing one of two things at every one , and everyone is great so it depends more on timing availability of their or for the colonoscopy . we can send you to dr. martin for the surgery who is at county surgical services down here or the other option is valley medical , and they do it at springfield .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] i think either direction they're good technicians of the colon .
[patient] okay , yeah whatever you can get me in , that works great .
[doctor] so i'll call around . now if you get that done and they tell you 10 years then you'll be good to go .
[patient] great , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day . let us know if you need anything else , okay ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right , assessment and plan .
[doctor] chronic chf . mixed presentation . had a exacerbation of cf , chf earlier in the spring . we switched her from a furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically she is doing a lot better . she's about 3 , 3 and a half pounds down in weight . breathing is non-labored . going to repeat ekg today but otherwise continue with her current regimen . labs checked and creatinine is appropriate .
[doctor] uh number 2 , pre-op examination . she is , she's having a right knee replacement end of june . also , she would like to have a colonoscopy performed which we'll try to have done at uh bartley regional , rightley regional hospital in the next month , uh , prior to a change in her insurance . this is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for . no family history of colon cancer .
[doctor] uh the next one is diabetes . a1c is 5.1 on the last check so no need for further a1c today . she may need another one prior to her surgery next month though . thanks .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicole Miller is a 71-year-old female who presents for follow-up. The patient was called in for a follow up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction. Her BNP had been 3000 in 03/2021, up to 6000 in 04/2021. She was increasingly dyspneic. We had changed her furosemide to torsemide at 20 mg by mouth daily. The patient is not on a potassium supplement currently. Her lisinopril had also been increased up to 10 mg daily in 03/2021.

I last saw her in 04/2021, and she had reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at East Metropolitan Hospital, so it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status prior to surgery. She is currently scheduled to have surgery on 06/24/2021. She plans to discontinue clopidogrel a week before her surgery.

The patient states that she has lost approximately 3 to 3.5 pounds since her last visit in 04/2021. Some of which may be water weight decreasing. She did report experiencing bilateral leg cramps which she treated with consumption of pickle juice, which did resolve the cramps. She thought the cramps were related to her being cold.

She is still taking iron supplementation. She denies any concerns with defecation.

Regarding her prior symptoms of heartburn, she denies any recent gastrointestinal issues. She notes that her heartburn was severe at one point but resolved after trying Prilosec for 2 weeks in 01/2021. She denies any issues with heartburn since that time and has stopped taking Prilosec altogether. She has since transitioned back to her original ""stomach medication"".

The patient is due for a colonoscopy. She is currently double covered with Medicare and private insurance.

ASSESSMENT

• Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.
• Preop examination.
• Diabetes mellitus.
• Colonoscopy

PLAN

Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.
She had an exacerbation of CHF earlier in the spring. We switched her from furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically, she is doing a lot better. She is about 1.5 kg down in weight. Her breathing is nonlabored. We are going to repeat an EKG today. Otherwise, continue her current regimen. Labs were checked and creatinine is appropriate. Her magnesium is below the preferred 2 at 1.7, with some occurrence of bilateral leg cramping, therefore we will start her on magnesium supplement.

Preop examination.
She is going to be having a right knee replacement at the end of 06/2021. We will schedule a preop check the first week or two of June prior to the surgery. She will discontinue clopidogrel for one week prior to knee replacement surgery; we will provide a reminder to patient of this as well.

Diabetes mellitus.
A1c is 5.5 on last check, so there is no need for a further A1c today. She may need another one prior to her surgery next month.

Colonoscopy.
The patient is overdue for a colonoscopy, which we will try to have done at County Hospital in the next month, prior to a change in her insurance. This is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for. No family history of colon cancer.

The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

Complete EKG today. Schedule a preop checkup 1st or 2nd week of June. Start magnesium supplement. Call the clinic with any questions or new symptoms.
"," [doctor] next patient is nicole miller . date of birth is 09/18/1949 . patient was called for a follow-up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction . bmp's been , uh , 3,000 in march , and is about six- was up to 6,000 in april . she was increasingly dyspneic . we changed her furosemide and torsemide 20 milligrams by mouth daily . uh to note , the patient is not currently on potassium supplement . her lisinopril had- has also been increased up to 10 milligrams daily in march . also did when i saw her last april . she reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at east metro . it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status before surgery . [doctor] hey , miss miller , how are you today ? [patient] i'm doing okay , thank you . [doctor] i asked you to come in today because we want to keep- we want you to have this knee surgery this summer but we want to keep a close eye on you to make sure a week before your surgery you do n't suddenly go into congestive heart failure and it gets postponed . [patient] yeah , that would not be good . [doctor] i see you're scheduled on the 24th for surgery . [patient] yeah , that's right . [doctor] okay , good . well it looks like you have lost about 3 , 3 and a half pounds since i saw you last in april . some of that might be water weight , but still , this is positive . [patient] yeah , i noticed that too . i think the oxyglutinine is helping as well . my urgency to use the bathroom is much better . [doctor] well that's great . [patient] yeah , i , i'm pleased about it too . [doctor] you ever get leg or finger cramps or anything like that ? [patient] yeah , i had leg cramps the other day , but i thought it might , was maybe just because i was cold as i had my ceiling fan on and fell asleep . i had cramps when i woke up in both legs right here . um i drank pickle juice and it went right away . [patient] haha , i know , i only drink about 4 ounces or so . [doctor] okay good . [doctor] sure just , just keep it in moderation . [patient] okay . [doctor] and then are you still on an iron supplement ? and are you using the bathroom okay ? [patient] uh yes , everything is good . [doctor] good . how is your heart burn doing ? any problems with that ? [patient] no , it did get bad for a while so i tried to take some prilosec and then stopped that other one . [doctor] okay . [patient] um i did that for like , gosh , i think it was two weeks back in january and have n't had any problems since . [doctor] great . [patient] um and after i stopped taking that um i went back to the stomach one , so i'm doing good now . [doctor] okay and you're still due for a colonoscopy , correct ? [doctor] all right , let's review your blood work real quick . i checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past but that is still doing great . [patient] good , that's a relief to hear . [doctor] your potassium is 3.9 so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was .7 not .8 so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your bun may be a tiny bit elevated at 23 which is the number we look for for dehydration sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . um so when i look at your numbers as a whole i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number- i sent to look at your heart failure number . there is a test called a bmp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3,000 and then went up to 6,000 in april before i made the change . i'm still waiting for those results . [patient] okay . [patient] what about , um what's it called , a1c ? does that show up ? [doctor] um i do n't think i ordered it but i could . your last a1c was 5.5 in march . [patient] all righty . [doctor] so your blood sugar is a little bit high , it was 169 today but that kind of depends on what you ate and you were n't fasting for the blood check so i might have to repeat that test for pre-op , but i do n't think we need to do it today . [patient] all righty that sounds good . [doctor] i checked your magnesium level because sometimes you uh urinate out magnesium with the water pills but it was normal at 1.7 and your blood pressure is also looking good . [patient] okay great . that all sounds awesome . [doctor] use my general physical exam template . [doctor] and take a couple of deep breaths for me . [doctor] your lungs sound pretty good to me so keep doing what you're doing . um uh , like i said , i think you're doing good overall but let's just talk about a few things . [patient] all righty . [doctor] so we often like to keep people with heart problems on magnesium and get their levels up to around the 2-ish range . yours is a little bit less than 2 and we want that 2-ish range because it can help stabilize the heart muscle . so i might recommend putting you on magnesium supplement . it's supposed to be twice a day so that's kind of annoying , but i know you're on other medicines twice a day too , so i think you'll do fine . [doctor] great . now before surgery we'll have to get you off your clopidogrel for a week beforehand . [patient] yes , okay , i have everything written down on my phone , and i have a letter taped to the side of my bed to remind me . [doctor] perfect ! we will give you a reminder as well . we will also need to complete a pre-op check within two weeks of your surgery during the first or second week of june . [patient] okay , i'll put that down . [doctor] you might also have to repeat an ekg before surgery which we could do today . i know i'm sure it feels like you're doing , you're always doing ekgs . um we do n't need to any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently , and we do n't need any more blood work because we did that today . [patient] yeah , i do a lot of ekgs . i'm basically a regular . but i'm happy to do one today , no problem . [doctor] lastly , once we get your knee surgery , um we , we should think about getting you a colonoscopy . we can do it here locally because you have medicare . do you have private insurance also ? [patient] yeah , i have both . [doctor] okay so yes , you can get it , your colonoscopy , wherever you'd like . [doctor] um i can put it in right now for , uh , for county for the next 30 days , and they might be able to get you in within the next few weeks . it should not take , it should not make you ineligible for the surgery . in other words completing a colonoscopy would not delay your surgery . [patient] okay , good . [doctor] so let me see . i've been doing one of two things at every one , and everyone is great so it depends more on timing availability of their or for the colonoscopy . we can send you to dr. martin for the surgery who is at county surgical services down here or the other option is valley medical , and they do it at springfield . [patient] okay , that sounds good . [doctor] i think either direction they're good technicians of the colon . [patient] okay , yeah whatever you can get me in , that works great . [doctor] so i'll call around . now if you get that done and they tell you 10 years then you'll be good to go . [patient] great , thank you . [patient] sounds good . [doctor] all right , assessment and plan . [doctor] chronic chf . mixed presentation . had a exacerbation of cf , chf earlier in the spring . we switched her from a furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically she is doing a lot better . she's about 3 , 3 and a half pounds down in weight . breathing is non-labored . going to repeat ekg today but otherwise continue with her current regimen . labs checked and creatinine is appropriate . [doctor] uh number 2 , pre-op examination . she is , she's having a right knee replacement end of june . also , she would like to have a colonoscopy performed which we'll try to have done at uh bartley regional , rightley regional hospital in the next month , uh , prior to a change in her insurance . this is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for . no family history of colon cancer . [doctor] uh the next one is diabetes . a1c is 5.1 on the last check so no need for further a1c today . she may need another one prior to her surgery next month though . thanks ."," [doctor] next patient is nicole miller . date of birth is 09/18/1949 . patient was called for a follow-up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction . bmp's been , uh , 3,000 in march , and is about six- was up to 6,000 in april . she was increasingly dyspneic . we changed her furosemide and torsemide 20 milligrams by mouth daily . uh to note , the patient is not currently on potassium supplement . her lisinopril had- has also been increased up to 10 milligrams daily in march . also did when i saw her last april . she reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at east metro . it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status before surgery .

[patient] yeah , i do a lot of ekgs . i'm basically a regular . but i'm happy to do one today , no problem . [doctor] lastly , once we get your knee surgery , um we , we should think about getting you a colonoscopy . we can do it here locally because you have medicare . do you have private insurance also ? [patient] yeah , i have both . [doctor] okay so yes , you can get it , your colonoscopy , wherever you'd like . [patient] okay , well my husband's insurance may be running out . might we be able to get the procedure done sooner ? maybe in the next 30 days ? is that okay ? [doctor] um i can put it in right now for , uh , for county for the next 30 days , and they might be able to get you in within the next few weeks . it should not take , it should not make you ineligible for the surgery . in other words completing a colonoscopy would not delay your surgery . [patient] okay , good . [doctor] so let me see . i've been doing one of two things at every one , and everyone is great so it depends more on timing availability of their or for the colonoscopy . we can send you to dr. martin for the surgery who is at county surgical services down here or the other option is valley medical , and they do it at springfield . [patient] okay , that sounds good . [doctor] i think either direction they're good technicians of the colon . [patient] okay , yeah whatever you can get me in , that works great . [doctor] so i'll call around . now if you get that done and they tell you 10 years then you'll be good to go . [patient] great , thank you . [doctor] you're welcome . have a great day . let us know if you need anything else , okay ? [patient] sounds good . [doctor] all right , assessment and plan . [doctor] chronic chf . mixed presentation . had a exacerbation of cf , chf earlier in the spring . we switched her from a furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically she is doing a lot better . she's about 3 , 3 and a half pounds down in weight . breathing is non-labored . going to repeat ekg today but otherwise continue with her current regimen . labs checked and creatinine is appropriate . [doctor] uh number 2 , pre-op examination . she is , she's having a right knee replacement end of june . also , she would like to have a colonoscopy performed which we'll try to have done at uh bartley regional , rightley regional hospital in the next month , uh , prior to a change in her insurance . this is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for . no family history of colon cancer . [doctor] uh the next one is diabetes . a1c is 5.1 on the last check so no need for further a1c today . she may need another one prior to her surgery next month though . thanks .","CHIEF COMPLAINT  Right knee replacement.

virtscribe,D2N026,"[doctor] dictating on donald clark . date of birth , 03/04/1937 . chief complaint is left arm pain . hello , how are you ?
[patient] good morning .
[doctor] it's nice to meet you . i'm dr. miller .
[patient] it's nice to meet you as well .
[doctor] so , i hear you are having pain this arm . is that correct ?
[patient] that's correct .
[doctor] okay . and it seems like it's worse at night ?
[patient] well , right now the hand is .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] and the thing started about two weeks ago . i woke up about two o'clock in the morning and it was just hurting something awful .
[doctor] uh- .
[patient] and then i laid some ice on it and it finally did ease up .
[doctor] okay , that's good .
[patient] so i got up , i sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down , thinking it would , like , help the circulation , but it did n't .
[doctor] okay , i see .
[patient] and so , after a while , when it eased off , maybe about four , five am , i laid back down and it did n't start up again .
[doctor] mm-hmm , okay .
[patient] um . i went back to sleep but for several nights this happened , like , over and over . so , i finally went to see the doctor , and i do n't really recall her name .
[doctor] okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about , though .
[patient] um , she's the one who sent me to you , so , i , i would , i would think so . but when i went to her after the third time it happened and she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve .
[doctor] probably . uh , do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] and do you notice it at other times besides during the night ?
[patient] um , some days . if it bothers me at night , then the day following , it usually will bother me some .
[doctor] okay . and do you just notice it in the hand , or does it seem to be going down the whole arm ?
[patient] well , it starts there and goes all the way down the arm .
[doctor] okay . have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . like , in terms of gripping things ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , this finger , i hurt it some time ago as well .
[doctor] really ?
[patient] yeah . it does n't work properly . or , it works very rarely .
[doctor] gotcha . and did i hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids , or ?
[patient] uh , well , she gave me some numbing medicine . it helped a little bit . the other two were a neck pill and gabapentin . uh , you should have my full list in your notes , though . since then it has n't really bothered me at night . also , just so you know , i am a va and i'm one percent disabled from this leg , um , issues from my knees down to my feet .
[doctor] okay . is it neuropathy ?
[patient] uh , yep .
[doctor] gotcha . that is good to know . all right , well , let's go ahead and take a look .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so , to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me . uh , just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good . and now , go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay . and now , come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way . great . and now , as far as you can towards that wall . uh , does that seem to bother you at all ?
[patient] no . well , actually , i do feel a little strain .
[doctor] okay . so , you feel it in the neck a little bit ?
[patient] yeah , just a little strain .
[doctor] okay . uh , now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands . great . now , hold your arms like this .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can . do n't let me strain it . okay , good . good . now , when i , i'm just touching your hands like this . does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off .
[patient] i see .
[doctor] so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ?
[patient] i think that sounds good to me .
[doctor] okay , good . and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list .
[patient] uh , no , i do n't .
[doctor] okay , good . and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin . um , are you taking 300 or 100 ?
[patient] um , not sure . my lady friend helps me handle this stuff .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i am taking eliquis , though .
[doctor] okay . um , so whatever you are doing you can just keep doing it , and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study , um , just so i know right where to put the medicine . and i will follow up with you after s- um , that's in . we can do the shot , just to make sure your arm is feeling better . sound good ?
[patient] sounds good . for the last couple of nights , though , my neck has not been bothering me .
[doctor] okay . s- um , so , presumably what's happening , then , is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off-tilt , uh , kilter , and it compresses the nerve roots there . now , if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very la- least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on , because probably this is something that will likely flare up again .
[patient] yeah , it , it has been for the last week , so , i understand .
[doctor] okay . all right . well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural , or do you think you're doing fine and you want to wait ?
[patient] well , my hand is still bothering me .
[doctor] okay . so , you're saying your neck is not bothering you but the hand is . okay . so then , let's just stick with the plan . mri of the neck , so we can see where the nerve roots may be compressed , that's giving your hand the issue . and then , we're going to set you up with the epidural .
[patient] okay . sounds good .
[doctor] all right . so , keep going with the gabapentin . i will order the imaging of your neck , and the shot will hopefully help some with those symptoms in your hand , and then we'll follow up afterwards .
[patient] all right . is the mri today ?
[doctor] um , you probably ca n't do it today , but let me talk with roy and see how soon we can get it done . just give me a quick minute , and then roy will come in and get things scheduled as soon as we can .

Left arm pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

He reports that his left arm pain began approximately 2 weeks ago. He woke around 2:00 am with intense pain in his left arm and hand. He applied ice and after 2-3 hours, the pain improved and he was able to go back to sleep, the pain did not return until that evening. After several nights of experiencing the left arm and hand pain, he was seen by Betty Ross, PA-C. She suspected a pinched nerve and completed x-rays of the cervical spine, prescribed gabapentin and prednisone, and referred the patient to us. The patient has benefited from the gabapentin and prednisone, reporting improvement of pain at night.

The pain initially was encountered at night, but the patient notes that the symptoms carry into the next day. He denies pain when moving his neck, turning his head, and moving his shoulder.

Mr. Clark does report a history of a left finger injury, stating “it rarely works”, and neuropathy in one leg from his knee to his foot which he receives 1% disability for. The patient is a veteran.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Peripheral neuropathy.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient is a veteran and receives 1% disability.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Gabapentin tablet.
Prednisone tablet.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Elderly Caucasian male in no apparent distress. Presents in wheelchair.

Neurologic
Upper extremities: 1+ bilateral biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, reflexes bilaterally, negative. Negative Hoffman's
Gait: Not assessed today.

Strength
Upper extremities: Normal throughout the biceps, triceps, deltoid, grip strength, and finger abduction, bilaterally.
Sensation: Intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.

Musculoskeletal
Cervical: Nontender over cervical spine. Mildly restricted cervical extension and right and left lateral rotation, which is symmetric, which gives him mild lateral neck pain, but no radicular pain. Spurling's maneuver is benign.

RESULTS

X-ray Cervical Spine, 06/04/2021.
Impression: Significant disc degeneration at C5-6 and to a lesser extent C4-5 and C3-4. Significant lower facet arthropathy. C6-7 and C7-T1 are difficult to visualize in the current x-rays.

ASSESSMENT

• Left upper extremity neuropathy, suspicious for cervical radiculopathy, possible contribution of peripheral neuropathy
• Neck pain in the setting of arthritis and disc generation

PLAN

I suspect that this is a flare of cervical radiculopathy. I am going to set him up for a cervical MRI. We will tentatively plan for a left C7-T1 epidural afterwards, although the exact level will be pending the MRI results. He will continue his home exercise program as well as twice daily gabapentin. We will follow up with him afterwards to determine his level of relief. He denies any blood thinners.

This plan was discussed in detail with the patient who is in agreement.

INSTRUCTIONS

Continue home exercise program and twice daily gabapentin. Schedule MRI and epidural injection. Follow-up after epidural."," [doctor] dictating on donald clark . date of birth , 03/04/1937 . chief complaint is left arm pain . hello , how are you ? [patient] good morning .

[patient] i see . [doctor] so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ? [patient] i think that sounds good to me . [doctor] okay , good . and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  James Alexander spurling is a 67-year-old white male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right upper extremity pain and weakness in his left arm. He states he has had pain at night since 2 weeks ago, but believes the problem is related to his arthritis. The patient denies any blood thinners and blames his lady friend for administering the first 2 medications. After the third visit, the patient was prescribed Gabapentin and eliquis, which have provided some relief. he continues to use both of these medications at home. During the day, his hand will sometimes bother him if moving his neck or turning his head requires turning the arm forward or backward. Currently, he is taking 300 mg of GabapanZA twice daily. This has allowed him to get through the night without experiencing any symptoms in the upper arms. Unfortunately, this has not been true for a number of nights in a row and we do not know what the cause is. Mr. Spurling suspects cervical radicularopathy. However, more likely the pain is coming from the neck and is most likely due to a pinched nerve. When he woke up this morning he felt his right hand was weak, so he proceeded to apply ice and noted that it felt about the same in both hands as it did a couple of days ago. Today he reports that his pain has spread down the whole arm, including the biceps, triceps brachioradiales, and his shoulder. Although he notes that the shoulder is not uncomfortable at all along the body, there is some uneasiness with movement of the left shoulder on its own. His last appointment was with a neurologist who prescribed him a neck pill and two medications that treated his symptoms: elizizine ( mg/dL) and Gabanganolol (mg/dl). These medications have been helpful for managing his headache and neck pain as of today. There is no evidence that these symptoms are neuropathic or distended, finger-like symptoms, however.

Strength and sensation is positive for left upper extremity neuropathy. The only weakness in the hand, however, was noted by a lady friend who helped handle the stuff. She is handling this stuff as well as the gabapentin.  ","ASSESSMENT  Left upper extremity neuropathy suspicious for cervical radicularopathy.  PLAN  After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I suspect this is a flare up of his previous issue. I will set him up for a cervical mri, and we will tentatively plan a left C7-T1 epidural afterwards. although the exact location will be dependent on the results of the Mri. We will also order a Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI)of the neck, so we can see where the nerve roots may be compressed. The patient denies any blood thinners, which would seem to indicate a pinched nerve. • Additional Testing ","ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  left upper extremity neuropathy suspicious for cervical radicularopathy. • Medical Reasoning: He is non-tender over his cervical spine.

CHIEF COMPLAINT  Left arm pain.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  James Alexander spurling is a 67-year-old white male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right upper extremity pain and weakness in his left arm. He states he has had pain at night since 2 weeks ago, but believes the problem is related to his arthritis. The patient denies any blood thinners and blames his lady friend for administering the first 2 medications. After the third visit, the patient was prescribed Gabapentin and eliquis, which have provided some relief. he continues to use both of these medications at home. During the day, his hand will sometimes bother him if moving his neck or turning his head requires turning the arm forward or backward. Currently, he is taking 300 mg of GabapanZA twice daily. This has allowed him to get through the night without experiencing any symptoms in the upper arms. Unfortunately, this has not been true for a number of nights in a row and we do not know what the cause is. Mr. Spurling suspects cervical radicularopathy. However, more likely the pain is coming from the neck and is most likely due to a pinched nerve. When he woke up this morning he felt his right hand was weak, so he proceeded to apply ice and noted that it felt about the same in both hands as it did a couple of days ago. Today he reports that his pain has spread down the whole arm, including the biceps, triceps brachioradiales, and his shoulder. Although he notes that the shoulder is not uncomfortable at all along the body, there is some uneasiness with movement of the left shoulder on its own. His last appointment was with a neurologist who prescribed him a neck pill and two medications that treated his symptoms: elizizine ( mg/dL) and Gabanganolol (mg/dl). These medications have been helpful for managing his headache and neck pain as of today. There is no evidence that these symptoms are neuropathic or distended, finger-like symptoms, however. Neurological: Denies pain in hand, hand-eye contact, weakness with objects

Bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Dylan Bennett is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.

The patient has been experiencing bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left, for approximately 1.5 years. His pain is localized to the medial aspect of his elbows and is described as being extremely sore, worse with increased use of his upper extremities. Of note, he utilizes heavy weights for strength training and was very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football, but he denies having any pain at that time. Applying ice to the area has not been helpful, but he does use ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that utilizes heavy weights for strength training. He was also very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football.

He is expecting a newborn baby in the near future.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Dylan Lee is a pleasant 27-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of his right elbow and his second elbow which are both extremely sore. He states that he has been lifting weights for approximately year and a half, and that his elbows bother him when he bends them.

[doctor] okay i think we all can say that but i do wan na just hey i do n't know that if you've tried it or not but there is a new restaurant down on fifth street and it is nothing but solids and i you know when i heard this i was like okay yeah it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing so if you ever get a chance yeah if you ever get a chance try try that i mean i think you would enjoy them because they're salads that they make are just out unbelievable so let me go ahead and i just have a few more questions and i'm gon na just ask these in in order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them do you have any headaches
[patient] really just when my blood pressure gets really high i have some mild headaches but otherwise i do n't have it on a regular basis

about my kidneys [doctor] okay yeah so okay let's before i dive into a lot of that tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling [patient] i would say you know most of the days i feel fine i'm still busy at work i definitely can tell though when my blood pressure is high [doctor] okay you measure it at home you you you measure your blood pressure at home [patient] yeah i she wanted me to get a blood pressure cuff so i did start getting checking my blood pressures probably like a few times a week [doctor] okay [patient] and so then i noticed that it has been getting higher the other day was even as high as one seventy over ninety [doctor] wow [patient] so i did call my pcp and she increased the meds again [doctor] yeah okay now i i just have a couple questions about that are you using a an electronic blood pressure recorder or do you have somebody help you at home [patient] yeah she i have a a electronic one an electronic arm one [doctor] okay okay yeah that's good that's good and have you ever tried do you go to cvs at all [patient] yeah i i do but i've noticed like since the pandemic i do n't see the blood pressures anymore [doctor] okay okay yeah i i thought the one down on main street they i thought they just brought that one back so [patient] did they [doctor] yeah [patient] that's good to know [doctor] you may wan na check that but okay so that's good but i what i'd like you to do with that is i'd like you to keep a record of them for me for my next visit with you so let's talk a little bit about your diet tell me how how is your diet what what are the what kind of foods do you like what do you eat normally [patient] alright do you want the honest answer [doctor] well yeah that would be better [doctor] okay i think we all can say that but i do wan na just hey i do n't know that if you've tried it or not but there is a new restaurant down on fifth street and it is nothing but solids and i you know when i heard this i was like okay yeah it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing so if you ever get a chance yeah if you ever get a chance try try that i mean i think you would enjoy them because they're salads that they make are just out unbelievable so let me go ahead and i just have a few more questions and i'm gon na just ask these in in order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them do you have any headaches [patient] really just when my blood pressure gets really high i have some mild headaches but otherwise i do n't have it on a regular basis [doctor] okay what about chest pain [patient] no chest pain [doctor] shortness of breath [patient] no shortness of breath [doctor] even with exertion [patient] even with exertion [doctor] okay do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed [patient] not if i'm on my feet for a long time i'll notice a little bit of swelling but otherwise no [doctor] okay and then a couple other family history questions anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure [patient] both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease [doctor] okay okay and in the the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on ten milligrams of norvasc daily and carvedilol twenty five milligrams twice a day is those the medicines you're on [patient] yes i was also on lisinopril before but with the adjustments yeah those are the ones i'm on [doctor] okay and so here's where i think we are going to go do you take any nonsteroidals like advil or motrin or aleve [patient] yeah just once in a while for my like any knee pain or back pain that i have but again not like everyday [doctor] okay and then lastly what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what i'm looking for [patient] i'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends [doctor] okay okay so lem me do a quick physical examination so i looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure it's still high it's one sixty nine over seventy four your heart rate was eighty eight and your oxygenation was ninety eight percent so those are all fairly good except that blood pressure's a little higher than we'd like to see now when i look at your neck i do n't see any jugular vein distention and i'm gon na listen here real quick no i do n't hear any carotid bruits i'm gon na listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and let me listen quickly to your heart i do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur and we'll we're gon na have to take a little bit look extra look at that that's when i i can hear an extra sound when i'm listening to your heart and you do have a small amount of one plus pitting edema bilaterally now i did so you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know and i think you're aware that that's what your your physician's been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and i'm gon na talk to your doctor but first thing before we make any more medication changes i want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound and what i'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing in the the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that i'm gon na order a you get another urine collection some morning aldosterone levels reining levels and a twenty four hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words but you know i'm i i'll write this all out for you i want you to decrease your alcohol i know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake i'm gon na give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and and they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any nonsteroidal medicines such as your advil or motrin the only thing i really want to want you taking is tylenol for any pain right now i am gon na prescribe one medicine and that's cardura four milligrams and i want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks i'd like you to return i want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time everyday that would be beneficial for me any questions for me [patient] no i i just it's a lot so i i'm hoping this will work and this will get it under control [doctor] yeah i i think you know this will be you know this we're gon na spend some time together so i'm glad to have you as a patient but you know we got ta try to get this under control and i'm gon na i'll be talking to your pcp just to let them know that you know what my plans are and we'll stay real in sync on treating this as we move forward does that sound like a plan [patient] that sounds good thank you [doctor] okay take care i'll talk to you later [patient] okay alright bye,"CHIEF COMPLAINT  Follow-up visit.

[doctor] alright
[patient] and then yeah it kinda hurt i quickly then twisted my myself around her because i was trying to catch myself but then i started to feel some pain in my foot
[doctor] mm-hmm okay have you ever injured that foot before

[doctor] okay so right now you're experiencing right leg pain but you have injured your your left leg before is that what i'm hearing
[patient] yeah that's fine
[doctor] alright were you able to continue playing
[patient] no i had to stop i actually it was like i had to be held from the field because i could n't put weight on my foot
[doctor] i'm sorry okay so what have you been doing for the pain since then
[patient] i wrapped it after a the game they had some ace wraps in their clubhouse and so i wrapped it up and then i iced it last night and i just kept it up on a pillow and then i took some ibuprofen
[doctor] okay could you one more time when did this injury happen
[patient] this happened about couple days ago
[doctor] okay so did you say whether does the ibuprofen help at all
[patient] yeah it helps a little bit but then you know it it you know after a while it wears out
[doctor] okay and then have you experienced any numb numbness or tingling
[patient] no no numbness
[doctor] okay alright any loss in sensation
[patient] no i mean i i can still feel like i can still feel my foot
[doctor] okay alright that's good to hear so you were playing tennis is that what you normally do to work out
[patient] i do i'm trying to learn but i can not afford tennis less lessons so me and my friends just hit the balls back and forth i do sleep
[doctor] i love it absolutely yeah my dad one time took me to play racquet ball and i learned the very bruisy way that that was n't for me yeah
[patient] that scares me
[doctor] it's it they they move pretty fast i'm not gon na lie alright so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do my my physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my findings but if you have any questions go ahead stop me let me know but i will be explaining along the way okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i've looked at your vitals and honestly they look great you know your blood pressure i see is one twenty five over seventy that's almost textbook respiratory rate we are seeing you at a smooth eighteen excuse me your temperature you're running normal ninety seven . one you're you're satting at a hundred percent so and then your pulse so that's interesting like you're you're going at like about sixty beats a minute so i think they're i think we're doing pretty well i'm gon na go ahead and listen to your heart on your heart exam i do n't appreciate any like murmur rub or gallop we have a nice regular rate and rhythm for your lung exam i do appreciate a little bit of stridor that's really interesting but i do n't hear any wheezes or rales so that's great for your i know this sounds weird but for your abdominal exam i do n't appreciate any rebound no guarding on your skin exam i do n't sorry like on your your head everything looks symmetrical your your mucosal membranes are normal you do n't feel hot to touch so that's great but i'm gon na do my foot exam okay so on the right foot there is some bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot there is associated swelling when i touch on your midfoot here does it hurt
[patient] no uh uh
[doctor] okay alright tenderness to palpation of the midfoot and positive piano key test of the first and second metatarsals alright it's also warm to touch alright so on your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch your left foot exam is normal capillary refill is appropriate pedal pulses are strong and sensation is intact so i know that before here we before i came in that we got an x-ray so i've reviewed the results of your x-ray of your right foot and it showed subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space alright i know those were a bunch of fancy words so now i'm gon na explain to you what that all means for my impression and plan your first problem is right foot pain consistent with a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones near the top of your foot right so the big part of your toe is the first metatarsal the second part where you can kinda like bend it right that's the that's the metatarsal that we're talking about based on your exam and what i'm seeing on your x-ray i am gon na recommend surgery for your foot the surgery will help place the bones in their proper positions using plates and screws to help prevent further complications there are also many ligaments at the top of your foot so i will be ordering an mri to further assess the fracture and any injury to the ligaments i know this is a lot do you have any questions
[patient] yeah do i have to do the surgery
[doctor] so i'm recommending it as there can be significant complications to your foot if you do n't it can lead to poor bone alignment or poor ligament healing which can lead to you losing the arch of your foot and becoming flat-footed you can also develop arthritis in that foot so yes i i i highly recommend it if you want to be able to walk and move about in a way that you are familiar with
[patient] i just hate that word surgery doc
[doctor] i know
[patient] you know it scares me every time i mean especially with my foot i want to be able to walk again and so i just get really worried i mean how long is the procedure usually too
[doctor] so it's actually
[patient] have to be in the hospital
[doctor] no no no no no it's actually a day surgery and you'll be able to go home the same day and then you will follow up with me here in the clinic in about a week you'll be in a cast and you will use crutches as you will not be able to use that foot for six to eight weeks after that you'll start gradually walking on your foot based on how you do so the procedure itself is not very long you will and so like since you will be able to go home that's great but you wo n't be able to drive especially since you're saying are you left handed or right handed
[patient] i'm right handed
[doctor] yeah so your your right foot is probably your dominant one and the also the one you're supposed to drive with so no you're gon na you're gon na need somebody to take you home but what
[patient] i mean
[doctor] uh uh
[patient] does that mean i'm out for the rest of the season i mean i wan na be able to get back and play again i really am i'm getting a little better so i
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] i really wan na keep on playing my tennis with my friends but
[doctor] yeah so unfortunately yes it does mean that you're out for the rest of the season but hopefully we can get you a great get you to a set up well for next season and in the meantime i think i'm gon na recommend after surgery that we get you to physical therapy i think that that's gon na be a really great way to like kinda strengthen the muscles and make sure that you're at peak performance before we put you back out there
[patient] i suppose so
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] thank you
[doctor] no problem so i do wan na let you know that there are some risks associated with any kind of surgical procedure i'm gon na bring you some paperwork and that my ma is gon na go over with you such as like risks of bleeding loss of sensation nerve damage all those things will be discussed with you and if you have any questions leading up to and even after your procedure go ahead and ask them and we'll be more than happy to help with that okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] good
[doctor] thank you
[patient] thank you","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Brittany Edwards is a 76-year-old female, right-hand-dominant, female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right foot pain. The onset of her pain began 2 days ago, when she was playing tennis and was trying to volley the ball when she got in front of another player and fell on the dorsal aspect of her right foot. She states that she quickly twisted her foot because she was trying to catch herself. The patient reports that she was unable to continue playing secondary to the pain. She states that she wrapped her foot after the game and iced it last night. The patient adds that she kept her foot up on a pillow and took ibuprofen for pain. She denies any numbness. The patient denies any loss of sensation.

The patient has a history of a left leg injury.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain.
Neurological: Denies numbness in the right foot.

PHYSICAL EXAM

SKIN: Warm
NEURO: Normal sensation.
MSK:
Examination of the right foot: Bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test of the 1st and 2nd metatarsals. Warm to touch. Neurovascular intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.
Examination of the left foot: Brisk capillary refill to all digits and light touch intact.

RESULTS

3 views of the right foot were taken. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is the presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.

ASSESSMENT

Right foot pain, consistent with a Lisfranc fracture.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays revealed a Lisfranc fracture. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we proceed with surgical intervention. The plan is to proceed with a right foot ORIF and all indicated procedures. We went over the risk, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. The risk include but not limited to continued pain, swelling, damage to surrounding tissue including nerves and blood vessels, numbness that could be permanent, infection, nonunion, malunion, failure of hardware, and need for further surgery. There is always a risk of amputation, heart attack, stroke, blood clots, pulmonary embolism, and death. There is a possibility of chronic pain and the inability to get back to the previous level of function. The patient wishes to proceed with the operation and she will follow up with me on the day of surgery. In the meantime, I have recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen her right foot.
", [doctor] alright brittany so i see that you are experiencing some right foot pain could you tell me what happened [patient] yeah well i was playing tennis and i was trying to you know volley the ball [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] it was like a double game and i was trying to volley the ball and i got in front of another player and actually ended up falling on top of my foot [doctor] alright [patient] and then yeah it kinda hurt i quickly then twisted my myself around her because i was trying to catch myself but then i started to feel some pain in my foot [doctor] mm-hmm okay have you ever injured that foot before [patient] yeah no sorry i injured my other foot before not this foot [patient] no i had to stop i actually it was like i had to be held from the field because i could n't

up and then i iced it last night and i just kept it up on a pillow and then i took some ibuprofen [doctor] okay could you one more time when did this injury happen [patient] this happened about couple days ago [doctor] okay so did you say whether does the ibuprofen help at all [doctor] okay and then have you experienced any numb numbness or tingling [patient] no no numbness [doctor] okay alright any loss in sensation [patient] no i mean i i can still feel like i can still feel my foot [patient] i do i'm trying to learn but i can not afford tennis less lessons so me and my friends just hit the balls back and forth i do sleep [doctor] i love it absolutely yeah my dad one time took me to play racquet ball and i learned the very bruisy way that that was n't for me yeah [doctor] it's it they they move pretty fast i'm not gon na lie alright so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do my my physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my findings but if you have any questions go ahead stop me let me know but i will be explaining along the way okay [patient] okay [doctor] alright so i've looked at your vitals and honestly they look great you know your blood pressure i see is one twenty five over seventy that's almost textbook respiratory rate we are seeing you at a smooth eighteen excuse me your temperature you're running normal ninety seven . one you're you're satting at a hundred percent so and then your pulse so that's interesting like you're you're going at like about sixty beats a minute so i think they're i think we're doing pretty well i'm gon na go ahead and listen to your heart on your heart exam i do n't appreciate any like murmur rub or gallop we have a nice regular rate and rhythm for your lung exam i do appreciate a little bit of stridor that's really interesting but i do n't hear any wheezes or rales so that's great for your i know this sounds weird but for your abdominal exam i do n't appreciate any rebound no guarding on your skin exam i do n't sorry like on your your head everything looks symmetrical your your mucosal membranes are normal you do n't feel hot to touch so that's great but i'm gon na do my foot exam okay so on the right foot there is some bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot there is associated swelling when i touch on your midfoot here does it hurt [patient] no uh uh [doctor] okay alright tenderness to palpation of the midfoot and positive piano key test of the first and second metatarsals alright it's also warm to touch alright so on your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch your left foot exam is normal capillary refill is appropriate pedal pulses are strong and sensation is intact so i know that before here we before i came in that we got an x-ray so i've reviewed the results of your x-ray of your right foot and it showed subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space alright i know those were a bunch of fancy words so now i'm gon na explain to you what that all means for my impression and plan your first problem is right foot pain consistent with a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones near the top of your foot right so the big part of your toe is the first metatarsal the second part where you can kinda like bend it right that's the that's the metatarsal that we're talking about based on your exam and what i'm seeing on your x-ray i am gon na recommend surgery for your foot the surgery will help place the bones in their proper positions using plates and screws to help prevent further complications there are also many ligaments at the top of your foot so i will be ordering an mri to further assess the fracture and any

wrapped it after a the game they had some ace wraps in their clubhouse and so i wrapped it up and then i iced it last night and i just kept it up on a pillow and then i took some ibuprofen [doctor] okay could you one more time when did this injury happen [patient] this happened about couple days ago [doctor] okay and then have you experienced any numb numbness or tingling [patient] no no numbness [doctor] okay alright any loss in sensation [patient] no i mean i i can still feel like i can still feel my foot [doctor] okay alright that's good to hear so you were playing tennis is that what you normally do to work out [patient] i do i'm trying to learn but i can not afford tennis less lessons so me and my friends just hit the balls back and forth i do sleep [doctor] i love it absolutely yeah my dad one time took me to play racquet ball and i learned the very bruisy way that that was n't for me yeah [patient] that scares me [patient] okay [doctor] alright so i've looked at your vitals and honestly they look great you know your blood pressure i see is one twenty five over seventy that's almost textbook respiratory rate we are seeing you at a smooth eighteen excuse me your temperature you're running normal ninety seven . one you're you're satting at a hundred percent so and then your pulse so that's interesting like you're you're going at like about sixty beats a minute so i think they're i think we're doing pretty well i'm gon na go ahead and listen to your heart on your heart exam i do n't appreciate any like murmur rub or gallop we have a nice regular rate and rhythm for your lung exam i do appreciate a little bit of stridor that's really interesting but i do n't hear any wheezes or rales so that's great for your i know this sounds weird but for your abdominal exam i do n't appreciate any rebound no guarding on your skin exam i do n't sorry like on your your head everything looks symmetrical your your mucosal membranes are normal you do n't feel hot to touch so that's great but i'm gon na do my foot exam okay so on the right foot there is some bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot there is associated swelling when i touch on your midfoot here does it hurt [patient] no uh uh [doctor] okay alright tenderness to palpation of the midfoot and positive piano key test of the first and second metatarsals alright it's also warm to touch alright so on your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch your left foot exam is normal capillary refill is appropriate pedal pulses are strong and sensation is intact so i know that before here we before i came in that we got an x-ray so i've reviewed the results of your x-ray of your right foot and it showed subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space alright i know those were a bunch of fancy words so now i'm gon na explain to you what that all means for my impression and plan your first problem is right foot pain consistent with a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones near the top of your foot right so the big part of your toe is the first metatarsal the second part where you can kinda like bend it right that's the that's the metatarsal that we're talking about based on your exam and what i'm seeing on your x-ray i am gon na recommend surgery for your foot the surgery will help place the bones in their proper positions using plates and screws to help prevent further complications there are also many ligaments at the top of your foot so i will be ordering an mri to further assess the fracture and any injury to the ligaments i know this is a lot do you have any questions [patient] yeah do i have to do the surgery [doctor] so i'm recommending it as there can be significant complications to your foot if you do n't it can lead to poor bone alignment or poor ligament healing which can lead to you losing the arch of your foot and becoming flat-footed you can also develop arthritis in that foot so yes i i i highly recommend it if you want to be able to walk and move about in a way that you are familiar with [patient] i just hate that word surgery doc [doctor] i know [patient] you know it scares me every time i mean especially with my foot i want to be able to walk again and so i just get really worried i mean how long is the procedure usually too [doctor] so it's actually [patient] have to be in the hospital [doctor] no no no no no it's actually a day surgery and you'll be able to go home the same day and then you will follow up with me here in the clinic in about a week you'll be in a cast and you will use crutches as you will not be able to use that foot for six to eight weeks after that you'll start gradually walking on your foot based on how you do so the procedure itself is not very long you will and so like since you will be able to go home that's great but you wo n't be able to drive especially since you're saying are you left handed or right handed [patient] i'm right handed [doctor] yeah so your your right foot is probably your dominant one and the also the one you're supposed to drive with so no you're gon na you're gon na need somebody to take you home but what [patient] i mean [doctor] uh uh [patient] does that mean i'm out for the rest of the season i mean i wan na be able to get back and play again i really am i'm getting a little better so i [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] i really wan na keep on playing my tennis with my friends but [doctor] yeah so unfortunately yes it does mean that

aci,D2N050,"[doctor] hey mason good to see you today so let's see you here in my notes for evaluation of kidney stones your your pcp said you had some kidney stones so you got a referral over so can you tell me a little bit about that you know what happened when did you first notice them
[patient] yeah it was about you know about a week ago and i was working down in the the barn with the horses and you know i was moving some hay but i developed this real sudden onset of pain in my right back and i thought it initially it was from throwing hay but it i broke out into a sweat i got real nauseated and that's when i went and saw my doctor and he ordered a cat scan and said that i had a kidney stone but you know that's i i've never had that before my father's had them in the past but yeah so that's that's how that all happened
[doctor] okay so you said you had the pain on the right hand side does it move anywhere or radiate
[patient] well when i had it it would it radiated almost down to my groin
[doctor] okay
[patient] not the whole way down but almost to the groin and since then i have n't had any more pain and it's just been right about there
[doctor] okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go
[patient] well when i you know after i found out i had a disk a kidney stone it came a couple times but it did n't last as long no i've been i've been straining my urine they told me to pee in this little cup
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and i've been straining my urine and you know i do n't see anything in there
[doctor] okay have you noticed any blood in your urine i know you've been draining probably take a good look at it has it been darker than usual
[patient] no not really not really darker
[doctor] okay so have you had kidney stones before and then you said your father had them but
[patient] i've never had a kidney stone my dad had them a lot but i've never had one
[doctor] okay alright so let me do a quick exam of you your vital signs look good i do n't see any fever or your blood pressure and heart rate are fine so let me do a quick physical exam let me press here on your belly so on your examination of your abdomen there is no tenderness to to pain to palpation of the abdomen there is no rebound or guarding there is cva there is tenderness on the right side so that means
[patient] i have a stroke
[doctor] can you repeat that
[patient] i did i have a stroke
[doctor] no no no no no so that means like everything is normal right but i feel like you you you have some tenderness and inflammation over your kidney so that has to be expected because you do have a kidney stone so i did review the results of your ct and it does show a stone that's measuring point five centimeters located in the proximal right ureter and that's that duct that classes from your your kidney to down to your bladder there is no evidence of hydronephrosis that would mean that the stone is obstruct obstructing the ureter causing swelling in the kidney so there is there is no evidence of that so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone so right now i'm gon na recommend that we we have you push fluids just to help facilitate you urinating and passing the stone i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours for pain and you can continue to take tylenol between that for any breakthrough pain and you already have a strainer so that's good continue to use that and we can see continue that until the stone hasses and i'm also gon na order a bmp and your urinalysis and urine culture just to make sure that everything else is okay with you and based on urinalysis we can see if we need to prescribe you antibiotics see if you have any type of infection i do want to see you back in about one to two weeks and hopefully by that time you you passed the stone but if not we can discuss further treatment lithotripsy it's like a shock wave kinda breaks up that stone it's not it's not that invasive procedure but we can just we can discuss that if it has n't passed in that one to two weeks that sound good
[patient] that sounds perfect dear too
[doctor] alright
[patient] thank you document
[doctor] so i will see you in a week or so and hopefully you've passed that stone and i'll send my nurse in with that prescription
[patient] okay thank you
[doctor] thanks","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Kidney stones.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mason Ward is a pleasant 80-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of kidney stones. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 1 week ago when he was in his barn moving hay when he had a sudden onset of right back pain. The patient initially thought his pain was due to throwing hay; however, he broke out into a sweat and became nauseated. He was seen by his primary care physician, who ordered a CT scan and told him that he had a kidney stone. He denies having kidney stones before, but states that his father has a history of kidney stones in the past. He explains that when he had pain, which has now resolved, it would radiate almost to his groin. The patient describes the pain as intermittent after he found out it was a kidney stone. He explains that he has been straining his urine, but has not seen anything. He denies any hematuria.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right back pain.

VITALS

Vitals look good, blood pressure and hear rate are within normal limits. Temperature is within normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the abdomen: No pain with palpation of the abdomen. No rebound or guarding. There is CVA tenderness on the right side.

RESULTS

The CT scan of the abdomen revealed a stone that is measuring 0.5 cm located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Right kidney stone.

PLAN

We reviewed the patient's CT results in detail today. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have prescribed the patient oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours for pain. He may continue to take Tylenol between the oxycodone doses for any breakthrough pain. The patient should continue to use the strainer when he urinates until the stone passes. I have also recommended that we obtain a BMP, urinalysis, and urine culture to evaluate for any signs of infection.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his symptoms have not improved, we will discuss further treatment options including lithotripsy.", [doctor] hey mason good to see you today so let's see you here in my notes for evaluation of

[patient] okay does it throb ache burn what kind of pain do you get with it
[doctor] it's almost like a throbbing pain but occasionally it becomes almost like a a sharp stabbing pain especially if i move it or spend too much time walking i i find myself walking on my heel just to keep that toe from bending
[patient] okay sorry i got a text and
[doctor] well that's okay you know what i i you know i what i really you know i love to ride bikes have you you ride bike at all
[patient] no i hate riding a bike i'm more of a runner
[doctor] my gosh i love to ride i ride the lot of rails the trails i mean i go all the last year i put in over eight hundred miles on rails the trails
[patient] yeah those those are nice
[doctor] yeah
[patient] does it does riding your bike bother your big toe
[doctor] no because i i kinda pedal with the the back of my feet you know on that side
[patient] okay do do you wear clips or are you just wearing a regular shoe and on a regular pedal
[doctor] i'm on a regular shoe some most of the time i'm in my flip flops
[patient] okay okay the how is there anything that you were doing out of the ordinary when this started
[doctor] no i do n't that's the thing i do n't remember an injury if it was something that i injured i think i would have just ignored it and would n't have showed up here but when it got red and warm to touch that's when i i was really concerned
[patient] okay do does even light pressure to it bother it like at night when you're laying in bed do the sheets bother
[doctor] absolutely i was just gon na say when i'm in bed at night and those sheets come down on it or i roll over yeah that hurts a lot
[patient] okay have you done anything to try to get it to feel better any soaks or taking any medicine
[doctor] i take you know like a two ibuprofen a day and that does n't seem to help
[patient] okay
[doctor] alrighty
[patient] let me see your your foot here and let me take your big toe through a range of motion if i push your top to bottom
[doctor] yeah ouch
[patient] big toe joint that okay and let me move it up where as i bend it up does that hurt
[doctor] it hurts but not as much as when you moved it down
[patient] okay so i'm moving it down here and it i've got about ten degrees of plantar flexion does that hurt
[doctor] yeah it a little when you take it a little further
[patient] if i go a little bit further to twenty degrees does that hurt
[doctor] that hurts more yeah
[patient] okay if i push in on your big toe and move it back and forth does that hurt
[doctor] yes it does and it it's almost like those joints that when you push it back it's almost like it's grinding a little bit too
[patient] okay if i push in between your big toe and your second toe here does that hurt
[doctor] a little bit but not terrible
[patient] okay what about if i push on the other side here
[doctor] yeah yeah right there on the outside of it absolutely
[patient] okay
[doctor] yep
[patient] okay and i'm feeling a little bit of bone spur here as well let me let me get an x-ray
[doctor] okay
[patient] and after we take a peek at that we'll develop a plan
[doctor] okay
[patient] so at this point what would i do if i'm going out of the room and then coming back
[doctor] you could hit pause or hit the stop button and just restart it the next time you come in
[patient] okay alrighty so taking a look at your x-ray and you do have you you have a large spur there on the top of your big toe joint
[doctor] oh
[patient] and you've lost a lot of the cartilage
[doctor] oh
[patient] and so you you've got some arthritis in there we we call this hallux rigidus and treatment for this to start off with we we put an insert in your shoe called an orthotic and we give you a little bit of anti-inflammatory medication or like a drug called meloxicam you only have to take it once a day
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's usually pretty well tolerated have you ever had any trouble with your stomach
[doctor] no never never had any problems with my stomach i love the i love the mexican's food the hotter the better so i hope i never get a problem with my stomach
[patient] i hope you do n't either one of the things that we get concerned about with an anti-inflammatory like that is that it can irritate the stomach so if you do start to notice that you're getting heartburn or pain right there
[doctor] yeah
[patient] below your your sternum you would need to stop taking the medicine and give me a call
[doctor] okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i wan na see you back in two weeks to see how you're doing with that if you're not seeing significant improvement then we may have to talk about doing things that are a little more invasive like doing a shot
[doctor] okay
[patient] or even surgery to clean out the joint sometimes
[doctor] is that surgery
[patient] i have to
[doctor] would that be
[patient] i'm sorry
[doctor] would that be surgery clean out the joint
[patient] yeah that would
[doctor] okay
[patient] that would be surgery if if we went in and cleaned out the joint sometimes in really severe cases we even just have to fuse the big toe joint we put it in a position of optimal function and we fuse it there and then your pain goes away you lose some motion but you've already lost quite a bit of motion and and the pain goes away so that that surgery really is very effective but let's try to run from my knife a little bit longer
[doctor] okay well you know i do n't think i'm gon na be able to do my work job i'm on my feet every day and i it's and and quite frankly it's fishing season so do you think you can give me a couple weeks off so i can get out and get some fishing done
[patient] no i want you to be doing your regular activities i want to know how this because if i put you out of work can you come back in and say it feels better well is was it because of the treatment or because of the rest so no i want you to keep working i want you to do your regular activities and i really want you to put these orthotics to the test and this medicine to the test and we will see how you're doing in two weeks
[doctor] okay where i really like catching blue going croppy so okay we'll we'll i'll i'll keep working then i'll find time to do that later
[patient] very good we will see you in two weeks
[doctor] okay thank you","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right great toe pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Joseph Walker is a pleasant 58-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right great toe pain. The onset of his pain began 2 weeks ago, however it worsened last week. He noticed the pain worsening when he was at a trade show convention and he could not ambulate as he was forced to stand there as the pain was there the whole time. He denies any specific injury. The patient describes his pain usually as throbbing and burning, but notes it occasionally changes to sharp, stabbing pain especially with movement or prolonged ambulation. His symptoms also include redness to the right great toe. The patient states that he has been ambulating on his heel to keep his toe from bending. He reports that his pain is present even with the slightest of pressure, which he notes is worse at night when his sheet is touching his right toe. He adds that he has been taking 2 ibuprofen per day, which does not provide him with relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that he likes to bicycle ride.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right great toe pain.
Skin: Reports redness.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right great toe reveals 10 degrees of plantar flexion with pain. Pain to palpation of the right great toe, between the big toe and 2nd toe. Palpated a bone spur on the right great toe.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right great toe taken today in office reveals a large bone spur on the anterior aspect of the right great toe joint. There is a loss of cartilage with some arthritis present.

ASSESSMENT

Right foot hallux rigidus.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays revealed hallux rigidus. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we begin with conservative treatment in the form of custom orthotics. I have also prescribed the patient meloxicam once a day to treat the pain. The patient was instructed to discontinue use and contact the office if gastrointestinal issues develop. I advised the patient that I want him to continue his regular activities.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his pain does not improve with the orthotics, I will recommend a cortisone injection or surgical intervention.", [patient] hi good afternoon joseph how are you doing today [doctor] i'm doing well

COMPLAINT  Big toe pain.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Joseph Martinez is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a large spur in his big toe. The onset of his pain began 2 weeks ago, when he was limping around at a trade show. He denies any specific activity or injury. However, last week, Martinez became concerned as his toenail became red and warm to touch, and he became uncomfortable enough to call for help. His pain has been intermittent at best, with some brief periods of severe pain, however, he estimates his toe may throb up to 2 hours per day. For more information contact your local clinic or call 1-800-878-2620. Today’s patient reports a history of arthritis and a significant amount of cartilage loss. When first aware of the problem, the patient was able to ignore the pain and joke about wearing a clip, wearing flip flops, or wearing his feet to work. Over the last few days, his symptoms have become more severe. At times he finds it necessary to walk on his heel. During these episodes, patients report a throbbing pain in the middle of their toe, a burning sensation near the tip, as well as a sharpening pain at the rear end. Occasionally this pain will turn into an intense throb. Other symptoms include:Musculoskeletal: Painful tingling, nausea, vomiting. Neurological: Denies sleep disturbance.

Mr. Taylor notes that it has been stressful for him the past couple of months as they moved from the West Coast to the East Coast, so he has been drinking more, and having pizza, and burgers more.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and barium swallow findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have prescribed the patient Protonix 40 mg first thing in the morning to treat his acute esophagitis. I have also prescribed the patient Carafate 1 gram 4 times daily for 1 month to help coat the lining of his esophagus and stomach. I recommended a upper endoscopy for further evaluation. I have also advised him to change his diet, decrease alcohol, and caffeine. I have also advised him to avoid citrus foods, fruits, and spicy foods until his symptoms have improved. We discussed that he should eat slowly and chew his food thoroughly to avoid big pieces of food. All questions were answered.

Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Logan Walker is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history significant for diabetes type 2, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who presents today with back pain.

Mr. Walker reports that he was helping his daughter move some heavy equipment and lifted some heavy boxes a little too quickly on Saturday. He thought he heard a pop when he moved and he had to lie down for about an hour before his pain resolved. He has had stiffness ever since. The pain is located in his lower back. He took Tylenol, ibuprofen, and used Icy Hot on the area, but it did not seem to help. The patient endorses some tingling in his toes on his right foot, which resolved Sunday afternoon. He finds it difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep at night, and he tends to lie on his right side, which seems to help a little bit.

Regarding his diabetes type 2, Mr. Walker reports that he has not cooked a meal at home in weeks, due to travel. He notes that his diet has not been great, and he thinks he needs to eat clean for a couple of weeks.

He monitors his blood pressure at home and it is under control for the most part.

Regarding his osteoarthritis, Mr. Walker reports occasional aggravation of his knee when he runs too much or lifts boxes that are too heavy.

The patient denies chest pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers, and chills.

Iron deficiency anemia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mrs. Christina Cooper is a 65-year-old female who presents with a long-history of iron deficiency anemia.

The patient reports she has been living with anemia since she was 13 years old. She attempted to donate blood on 12/2019 but was unable to due to her anemia. She has a history of heavy menstruation and a hysterectomy in 1996. She completed a colonoscopy 5-6 years ago with nonsignificant findings.

ASSESSMENT

• Iron deficiency anemia

Mrs. Cooper is a 65-year-old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12/2019 and was unable to donate blood. Her follow-up blood work in 01/2020 revealed a low hemoglobin, stable hematocrit, and normal iron labs, although, ferritin was low. She has been taking ferrous sulfate 325 mg by mouth.

PLAN

I have asked her to continue each ferrous sulfate dose with vitamin C found in orange juice for the next 12 weeks then recheck CBC, iron ferritin, B-12, and folate. A referral was sent for her to see a hematologist. We will plan for EGD and colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or GI bleed. If this is inconclusive, capsule endoscopy can be considered.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule upper endoscopy, colonoscopy and appointment with hematologist. Return to the clinic if symptoms worsen."," [doctor] today i'm seeing christina cooper . her date of birth is 07/01/1954 . uh , ms. cooper is a new patient who was referred by diane nelson for a long-standing iron deficiency anemia .

Left shoulder pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Wayne Taylor is a pleasant 66-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left shoulder pain. The onset of his pain began 3 weeks ago. He denies any specific injury. The patient states he is active and has been renovating his basement. He reports a history of intermittent aches and pains in his left shoulder. He has difficulty reaching for or lifting any objects. He adds that he avoids reaching overhead secondary to the pain. The patient describes his pain as constant and worsening. He notes his pain is unbearable when lying on his left shoulder at night. He denies any numbness or tingling in the bilateral upper extremities. He has been taking 2 Extra Strength Tylenol every 6 to 8 hours, which provides some relief.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain. Neurological: Denies numbness or tingling in the bilateral upper extremities.

VITALS

All vital signs are within the normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds.

NEURO: Normal sensation. Sensation is intact to light touch in the left upper extremity.
MSK: Examination of the left shoulder: Limited active and passive ROM. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints. Good hand grip.

RESULTS

X-rays of the left shoulder were obtained and are reviewed today. These reveal there are no fractures.

ASSESSMENT

Left shoulder pain, most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy. I recommend obtaining an MRI of the left shoulder to further assess the rotator cuff. I will also refer him to formal physical therapy to strengthen his left shoulder for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. The patient was provided with educational materials regarding expectations related to his physical therapy. He may continue to take Tylenol as needed. If his symptoms do not improve with physical therapy, we will consider a steroid injection to the left shoulder. All questions were answered.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me after he has completed his course of physical therapy.", [doctor] hi wayne how're you today [patient] i'm doing okay aside from this left shoulder pain that i've
