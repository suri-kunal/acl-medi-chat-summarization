ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Martha Collins is a 50-year-old female with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure, depression, and hypertension who presents for her annual exam.

Congestive heart failure.
• Medical Reasoning: She has been compliant with her medication and dietary modifications. Her previous year's echocardiogram demonstrated a reduced ejection fraction of 45%, as well as some mitral regurgitation. Her cholesterol levels were slightly elevated on her lipid panel from last year.
• Additional Testing: We will order a repeat echocardiogram. We will also repeat a lipid panel this year.
• Medical Treatment: She will continue with her current medications. We will increase her lisinopril to 40 mg daily and initiate Lasix 20 mg daily.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with dietary modifications.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: She is doing well with weekly therapy.

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: She has been compliant with dietary modifications but has been inconsistent with the use of her medication. She attributes elevations in her blood pressure to increased stress.
• Medical Treatment: We will increase her lisinopril to 40 mg daily as noted above.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to take her lisinopril as directed. I advised her to monitor her blood pressures at home for the next week and report them to me.

Healthcare maintenance.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient is due for her routine mammogram.
• Additional Testing: We will order a mammogram and have this scheduled for her.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

She was rear-ended by a vehicle in a 4-way traffic accident. The patient states she got really angry with the person who hit her, so she went to flip him the bird. However, she hit the ceiling of the car, causing damage to her car tranche, while the driver behind her was distracted by something and did not see or was not watching. He states he thinks other cars were going by and they were hailing their vehicles and that is when the pain started. When did this happen? the patient reports the accident happened on a Saturday so about 4 to 5 days ago. Her car was at a stoplight when it was stopped by another vehicle, and the suspect driver says that he or she was surprised that the other vehicles were behind me. They do not believe that any passengers were injured as they would have been able to avoid injury had they not been texting. This patient denies any fractures in the third finger, bruising, or contraindications to other fingers, such as the ulnae ( phillip's), tibane, ambien, tramadol, 50 mg over 6 hours, plus versed in painkiller for pain, Zoloft every 10 mg  Gastrointestinal: Digestive: Endorses digoxin for agitation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient is a 41-year-old female who suffers from atrial fibrillation. She was rear-ended by a slow motor vehicle driver who became angry at her for hitting the ceiling with a bird. The person who hit her, however, was not watching. He was the person behind her at the time of the accident. There were other cars going, and the patient became really angry with him, so he went to flip him the bird, but was a little too enthusiastic. This is the result of a right-hand pushdown resulting in a 3-inch total damage to the trunk of her car, which crumpled up a bit. No other injuries, just the Middle Finger.

CHIEF COMPLAINT  Right middle finger pain.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient is a 41-year-old female who suffers from atrial fibrillation. She was rear-ended by a slow motor vehicle driver who became angry at her for hitting the ceiling with a bird. The person who hit her, however, was not watching. He was the person behind her at the time of the accident. There were other cars going, and the patient became really angry with him, so he went to flip him the bird, but was a little too enthusiastic. This is the result of a right-hand pushdown resulting in a 3-inch total damage to the trunk of her car, which crumpled up a bit. No other injuries, just the Middle Finger. Of note, I am taking digoxin for afib. The tramadol is okay with that.

Roger Nelson is a 62-year-old male who presents for emergency room follow-up for chest pain. The patient was doing yard work over the weekend when he began to feel short of breath and a full chest pain for approximately hour. He denies a history of chest pain. The patient notes that after he finished he felt fine. He has not had any other symptoms since that time. He denies a family history of heart disease.

The patient underwent right knee surgery a couple of months ago and has been feeling well since then. He has been in rehab and recovery. He denies chest pain while doing exercises in physical therapy for his knee.

His blood pressure was noted to be 180/95 mmHg when he visited the emergency room. He notes that his blood pressure has not been as high as usual.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

Neck
• General Examination: I do feel a little large thyroid that is not tender. She has a carotid bruit on the right side. 

Respiratory
• Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. Cardiovascular
• Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, but I do hear 3/6 systolic ejection murmur. Gastrointestinal
• Examination of Abdomen: Soft. There is a healed scar on the right knee from prior knee surgery. Musculoskeletal
• Examination: There is no lower extremity edema.

RESULTS

Blood pressure is elevated.

EKG is normal.

Echocardiogram demonstrates decreased ejection fraction.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 62-year-old male who presents for emergency room follow-up. He presented to the emergency room for chest pain and elevated blood pressure of 180/95. His EKG from the emergency room was normal, but ejection fraction on echocardiogram was abnormal. His blood pressure today was still elevated.

Chest pain and hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: Given his recent episode of blood pressure elevation and chest pain, I suspect an element of coronary artery disease as well as pumping dysfunction.
• Medical Treatment: We will change his blood pressure regimen to carvedilol 25 mg twice a day. He should also continue lisinopril 10 mg a day and I want to see how his blood pressure does on that regimen. I also recommended cardiac catheterization on him to make sure that he does not have any blockages in his heart.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

He went to the emergency room for chest pain, but had been feeling well since then. There is no family history of any heart disease. The patient reports that he has never had that before. His blood pressure was about 180/95 when he went in. It was kept there for a few hours but seemed to regulate after effect. After the pain resolved, and he felt fine. He had had knee surgery a couple months ago and reports this is related to that. Their concern is that his lower extremity edema may be a factor. This is something that we will have to look into as well. All right?  Mrs. Taylor had her echocardiogram results released today. She does not feel any enlarged thyroid here and her lungs are clear. Her heart is in a regular rate and rhythm. However, she does hear a 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur. When asked if she ever had hypertension before, her response was usually no. That's why last week's episode was so surprising. They were concerned about it but it didn't seem to be an issue when she went home.

This is something that we will have to look into as well. All right?  Mrs. Taylor had her echocardiogram results released today. She does not feel any enlarged thyroid here and her lungs are clear. Her heart is in a regular rate and rhythm. However, she does hear a 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur. When asked if she ever had hypertension before, her response was usually no. That's why last week's episode was so surprising. They were concerned about it but it didn't seem to be an issue when she went home. Endorses the carvedilol, 25 mg twice a day as an anti-blockageantigastrophy drug, effective against osteoporid hormone and fungal necrotizing fenestrairidae.

Assessment

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  Mr. Roger Smith is a 62-year-old male who presents for emergency room follow-up for chest pain.  Chest pain, hypertension. • Medical Reasoning: His symptoms could be related to severe hypertension, but his blood pressure has been running at a slightly higher level than normal for the past several months. He also presents with a 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur, elevated thyroid levels, and a carotid bruit on the right hand side, as well as a healed scar from his prior knee surgery.Â Family history of coronary heart disease, including a cousin who had a cardiac catherization in 1996. The nurse will be in soon to schedule the cath for you, okay?","Subjective

CHIEF COMPLAINT  Emergency room follow-up for chest pain.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient has a healed scar on the right knee from his prior knee surgery a couple months ago. He has been feeling well since then. However, he does have an episode of chest discomfort last week when he went into the emergency room for some blood pressure, which was very high. This was initially thought to be related to severe hypertension, but it was kept him there for a few hours and it seemed to regulate after effect. There is no lower extremity edema at the present age of 62. No heart disease, any family history, and any history of any cardiac catheterization, such as the echocardiogram, or the cat scan of the patient's abdomen, where he had been doing better ever since. He is a 62-year-old male and has had carvedilol 10 mg a day for the past 2 1/2 months and no other symptoms since that time, except for this chestpain. With that, they did have the ECG and Ekg’s done and they feel good. They “ looked into”  Medical Question  • Blood Pressure: 180 over 95. • Cardiovascular Question: Y2: BP: 98 to 100.• Respiratory Question : 

Exam

PHYSICAL EXAM  Neck. There is no lower extremity edema. 

Results

RESULTS  Echocardiogram was obtained. 

Assessment

ASSESSMENT  • Medical Reasoning: The patient presents today for emergency room follow-up for chest pain.  PLAN  After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with this patient in regard to his current medical treatment plan. I encouraged him to continue his Lisinopril 10 mg daily regimen. We will schedule a cardiac catheterization on him and make sure that we don't have any blockages in his heart arteries responsible for the heart rate, which helps with coronary disease as well as his pumping function, of which I recommend continued carvedilol. • Patient Education and Counseling  INSTRUCTIONS "

Assessment

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  John is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history significant for anxiety and epilepsy who presents with an abnormal lab finding.  Anxiety. • Medical Reasoning: He is newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. His hemoglobin A1c was 8. He was borderline in the past but his last hospital visit was elevated due to stress and/or improper blood sugar monitoring. The nature of his lab findings are unknown at this time, but we will order metformin 500 mg twice daily. We will probably increase the dose over time. Any questions?  Neurologist: The patient is currently experiencing agitation leading into the winter. I discussed treatment options with the patient.","Subjective

CHIEF COMPLAINT  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  John is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history significant for anxiety and epilepsy who presents with an abnormal lab finding.  The patient was notified by the emergency room that he had a really high blood sugar and was in there with the nurse. He was not monitoring his sugar intake and strain he thinks over the last couple of weeks. This did not help much- Neither did the patient's anxiety. Today, he is feeling relatively good. However, he does have some trace pitting edema to his lower extremities which could be from stress and struggle. His epilepsy, any seizures recently? Not in a while. It was actually quite a few months and it was something minor but noth- nothing major ever since. He is currently on metformin 500 mg twice a day with his met epilepsy twice daily with its borderline in the past but now that it is almost the weekend, it's been a little bit better.

[patient] but overall i'm doing well , i'm actually taking the correct steps to get my life together .
[doctor] good . it's always great to hear . well let's take a look . uhm , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] please use my general exam template , all right . just take a few breaths .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] in and out .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , everything sounds good , no concerns there .
[patient] great . so i wanted to show you something .
[doctor] sure .
[patient] look at this .
[doctor] okay , this is your cholesterol ?
[patient] yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides . uh , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 milligrams per deciliter , and i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th .
[doctor] right .
[patient] now 5 months later look at my numbers .
[doctor] wow , that's remarkable .
[patient] is it the test ? it's the only change .
[doctor] i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this . i mean there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement , meaning those who get good levels of their test see their diabetic control improve .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless , we will take it .
[patient] i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping .
[doctor] yeah , that's an unbelievable difference .
[patient] 145 milligrams per deciliter from 265 milligrams per deciliter is awesome . i also read that it- it's cardioprotective .
[doctor] absolutely .
[patient] my red blood cell count has increased .
[doctor] yeah , i saw that . it's fine though .
[patient] stable .
[doctor] your psa today is also , uh , is good also . it's , uh , .6 i think .
[patient] yeah . , is it ?
[doctor] yeah , it was .5 last year and anything under 4 is good .
[patient] nice , that's good news .
[doctor] so it just needs to be checked every year or so .
[patient] so in terms of , uh , estrogen control i've been hearing that indole-3-carbinol , or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ?
[doctor] yeah , i've heard of it but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean , your levels are fine and we checked your estra- estradiol and it was not elevated , so .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do , uh , do any more tests ... any more than test once a year , excuse me .
[patient] okay , what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams ? i'm at 140 now .
[doctor] well , your levels are high .
[patient] are they right now ?
[doctor] well , i mean they were last time .
[patient] yeah but i just- just injected though , or i had right before that was taken .
[doctor] i know . i know you had then , uh , when did you inject this time ?
[patient] i figure i'm on my eighth day today .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so i'm due to dose on thursday or friday .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and ts on it . that helps me .
[doctor] that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you look well , your levels are good and you're feeling well .
[patient] yeah , i'm feeling good .
[doctor] i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you're feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean , i get it and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like , back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses . and then they would have a heart attack at 50 .
[patient] yeah , they have to be taking a lot .
[doctor] likely they are taking more than testosterone , but still .
[patient] and they are taking stuff for a long time .
[doctor] true . but right now i would not change your dose .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] make sense ?
[patient] it does , i appreciate the discussion .
[doctor] no problem . what pharmacy are you using ? have you changed it or anything ?
[patient] no changes , i use walmart pharmacy . i do need more cialis and finasteride .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i would prefer the paper prescription .
[doctor] for all of them ?
[patient] sure .
[doctor] all right , will do . i'm gon na get your prescriptions .
[patient] okay , thank you .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Hypogonadism.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Paul Edwards is a 59-year-old male, an established patient, who presents to the clinic today for hypogonadism. He was last seen on 11/24/2020. The patient’s history includes positive for HIV, and today he is concerned with gynecomastia.

The patient is doing well, overall, and feels the testosterone is helping. He reports weight stability, feels lively, good, more vigorous, and he is sleeping well. He also thinks the testosterone is having a positive effect on his blood work. He endorses that his triglycerides have always been elevated and adds that they were as high as 265 mg/dL. The patient presented a copy of his bloodwork, showing a significant decrease in his cholesterol after 5 months. Mr. Edwards questioned if the changes in his blood work were due to the testosterone. He also noted that his red blood cell count has not increased. The patient inquired about possible benefits of Indole-3-carbinol, which is a broccoli extract for estrogen control.

Currently, the patient is dosing 140 ng/dL of testosterone per week and inquired if his dose could be increased to 175 ng/dL. He recalled that he had recently injected testosterone before his last testosterone blood work was performed; last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL. The patient confirms continued daily use of Finasteride and Cialis, prescribed by me, and stated he needs a refill for both.

Mr. Edwards mentioned he is taking correct steps to get his life ""together."" He also uses a med calendar to help with medication compliance.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
HIV

SOCIAL HISTORY

Utilizes med calendar to support medication compliance.
Actively trying to get his life together.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Cialis 5 mg tablet by mouth on days he exercises, 2.5 mg tablet by mouth on days without exercise.
Finasteride 5 mg half tablet daily.
Testosterone cypionate 140 mg.

RESULTS

PSA 0.6 ng/mL.
Triglycerides 145 mg/dL.
Total testosterone 1500 ng/dL, 11/24/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Hypogonadism.

PLAN

I recommend maintaining current management. The patient’s last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL, although this level was likely related to his recent injection. He requested an increase to his testosterone cypionate from 140 mg to 175 mg, which I denied due to his already high testosterone levels. I counseled the patient on the risks associated with high testosterone levels and Indole-3-carbinol and it’s lacking evidence to support his estrogen levels. The last time his estradiol levels were checked, they were normal; recommend annual screening.

I provided paper prescription refills for Cialis and Finasteride.

Routine follow up of chronic medical conditions.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Eugene Walker is a 61-year-old male who presents today for a routine follow-up of his chronic medical conditions.

Today, the patient reports feeling more fatigued as of late. He notes that he usually rides his bike for about 20 to 30 miles and by the end of his ride he is tired enough that he will immediately fall asleep. The patient adds that he can fall asleep easily and gets about 6 or 7 hours of sleep per night. He believes he snores a bit but denies any signs of apnea.

Of note, the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic aneurysm repair on 01/22/2013. As he is now 8 years post-op, he has requested an echocardiogram from Dr. Lewis to review how he is doing currently. His last stress test was performed on 09/09/2019.

Mr. Walker reports that his wife and friends have told him that he has pursed lips when he walks. This has also been noticed by his other providers. He denies any wheezing.

Furthermore, the patient has noticed a 2 to 3 mm nodule in his right testicle, possibly with the epididymis but he is unsure. He has not had a vasectomy.

His current medication list only consists of clindamycin prior to dental procedures and vitamin D3 (50,000 IU on Sundays and 2000 IU the other 6 days).

From a preventative standpoint, the patient is due for the shingles vaccine and an MMR titer. He is fully vaccinated for COVID-19 with his first dose on 01/15/2021 and his second dose on 02/05/2021.

[doctor] yeah , i understand . [doctor] right . so , when was your last stress test ? [patient] it was september 9th , 2019 , because i'm eight years out from surgery , and back then , they said , you know , it's going to last eight years . and i'm at that year , so i just want to make sure . i asked dr. lewis for an echocardiogram to see how i'm doing . [doctor] yeah . [patient] but it's not ... like , nothing has changed drastically since i saw you . [doctor] okay . [patient] no , no wheezing . [doctor] on the testicle or the epididymis ?

[doctor] what time are you going to sleep , and about how many hours do you sleep a night ? [doctor] okay , so you're getting six to seven hours of sleep , and has your wife ever mentioned if you snore or stop breathing at any time ? [patient] i believe i snore a little bit , but she's never said anything about me not breathing .

[patient] hmmm
[doctor] i have been doing a lot of work in my basement and i even i put in a new ceiling so i do n't know if it's from all that activity doing that but otherwise that's that's all i can think of
[patient] okay so do you remember hitting it or anything like that
[doctor] no nothing at all
[patient] okay alright did you fall do you remember doing that
[doctor] no
[patient] okay hmmm so like a little mystery so have you had pain in that shoulder before
[doctor] i mean i'm very active so i can get pains in my shoulders but it's nothing that sometime some tylenol can help
[patient] okay and are you able to move the arm or is it kinda just stuck
[doctor] i'm having a lot of pain like i can move it but you know when i try to reach for something lifting anything and even like i do n't even try to put my hands over my head because it causes so much pain
[patient] alright so does that pain radiate anywhere or like where would you say it is in your shoulder
[doctor] it actually it stays pretty much just right at the shoulder it does n't go down anywhere
[patient] okay and the pain is it is it all the time or does it come and go
[doctor] it's pretty much all the time anytime i put any pressure on it like when i'm trying to sleep it hurts even more so it's been affecting my sleep as well
[patient] okay so i know you mentioned tylenol so this time i have n't taken anything for it
[doctor] yeah i i do the tylenol which usually works for me and it does take the edge off but i still have pain okay did you try icing it at all
[patient] i iced it initially but i have n't iced it at all recently
[doctor] alright
[patient] and so with your shoulder have you experienced any numbness in your arm or in your fingers
[doctor] no numbness or tingling
[patient] okay good so i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam and take a look at your your shoulder so i reviewed your your vitals everything looks good with that so touch here in your shoulder so your left shoulder exam you have limited active and passive range of motion so pressure here so that there is tenderness of the greater
[doctor] okay
[patient] tuberosity of the humerus let's see there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro
[doctor] yeah
[patient] acromioclavicular joints
[doctor] yeah yeah
[patient] and looks like you have good hand grip let me see so on the neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is is intact to light touch
[doctor] yes thank you yep
[patient] so you did get a we get we had to get a x-ray of your shoulder before you came in and so it's normal so that's really good so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you you do have that left shoulder pain so your symptoms are
[doctor] most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured tendon you have injured tendons and muscles that make up your shoulder and make up your shoulder muscles so what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na order an mri of your left shoulder
[patient] and so we're gon na begin with that just to make sure nothing else is going on have you done physical therapy before
[doctor] i have n't
[patient] okay so what i'm gon na do i'm going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so they can help you strengthen those muscles around your shoulder and that should definitely help with the pain during that time you can also continue to take tylenol i do n't think i need to prescribe anything else for the pain you said as it's working pretty good for you so if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which should provide some relief but i think right now we can just go with the the pt and hopefully that works to alleviate your injury so do you have any questions about the plan
[doctor] so like i said i'm really active do you think that this pain will ever go away
[patient] yeah so many patients are very successful with rehab and so we'll start with that and see how you do most most of the time once we build up those muscles around that shoulder you know things things the pain alleviates itself and and and you will be good to go back to working on your basement and running and jogging and lifting weights all all the active things people do these days
[doctor] okay alright thank you
[patient] bye
[doctor] okay bye","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left shoulder pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Alan Mitchell is a pleasant 69-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left shoulder pain. The onset of his pain began 3 weeks ago, without any improvement. He denies any specific injury; however, he has been renovating his basement and putting in a new ceiling. He does not recall hitting or falling onto the left shoulder. The patient states he is very active and has experienced left shoulder pain before that usually resolves with Tylenol.

The patient reports significant pain with reaching, lifting, and overhead activities. The pain is constant. He states the pain is primarily located in the left shoulder and denies it radiates down into the left arm. The patient also reports difficulty sleeping secondary to the pain. He denies any numbness or tingling in his left arm or fingers. He has been taking Tylenol for pain, which provides partial relief. He initially iced his shoulder but has not iced it recently. The patient denies he has done any physical therapy.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain. Neurological: Denies numbness or tingling.

VITALS

All vital signs are within the normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the left shoulder: Limited active and passive ROM. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or AC joints. Good hand grip. Neurovascularly intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Sensation is intact to light touch distally.

RESULTS

X-rays of the left shoulder were obtained and reviewed today. These are normal and reveal no fracture or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Left shoulder pain, likely rotator cuff tendinopathy.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. I have explained that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the left shoulder to evaluate for possible rotator cuff tendinopathy. The patient was provided with a referral to formal physical therapy. He will engage in a 6-to-8-week course in order to strengthen his left shoulder. I have also advised him to take Tylenol as needed for pain. If his symptoms do not improve, we may consider a steroid injection to the left shoulder.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion.", [doctor] alright you can go ahead [patient] hey alan i good to see you today so i looked here

Right foot pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elijah Reyes is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right foot pain. The patient was referred by his primary care physician. He sustained an injury yesterday when he dropped a landscape brick on his right foot while doing yard work. He was able to get up and continue working after the injury. He rates his pain level as an 11 out of 10. The patient also reports numbness in his entire right foot, which has been present for a long time. The patient denies taking any medication for pain.

The patient reports he fractured his right ankle 20 years ago. He received non-operative treatment with casting. He has experienced intermittent soreness and swelling in his right ankle since then.

The patient reports surgical history of his left ankle. He continues to experience soreness and occasional giving way of the left ankle.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of a right ankle fracture 20 years ago.

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of left ankle surgery.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain, right ankle soreness and swelling, and left ankle soreness and instability.
Neurological: Reports right foot numbness.

VITALS

All vital signs are within the normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Capillary refill is brisk in less than 3 seconds in the right foot. Strong bounding dorsalis pedis pulse.
NEURO: Normal sensation. Right foot motor and sensation are intact and equal to the contralateral side.
MSK: Examination of the right foot: Bruising on the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. I do appreciate associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation over the midfoot.

RESULTS

An x-ray of the right foot was obtained and reviewed today. It demonstrates dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases and presence of bony fragments.

ASSESSMENT

Right foot pain, due to a Lisfranc fracture.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. We discussed treatment options and I have recommended that we proceed with a right foot ORIF and all indicated procedures. We reviewed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. I advised him that this procedure will be performed in an outpatient setting and he will be discharged home that same evening. He will then follow up with me 24 hours post procedure, and again 2 weeks later. I explained that he will be placed in a cast and will remain non-weight-bearing for 6 to 8 weeks. He will use crutches while ambulating and we will advance his weight-bearing gradually based on how he tolerates the procedure.

I have also recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right foot to further assess the ligaments. I explained to him that if he has poor bone alignment or ligament healing, this can lead to losing the arch in his foot causing pes planus and developing arthritis. I will send an order to the outpatient MRI facility downstairs for him to obtain the MRI this afternoon.

The patient wishes to think over his options before proceeding with the operation.", [doctor] hey elijah how are you [patient] it's a little sore today but you know i hurt my foot before but this is

Right ankle pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Anna Diaz is a pleasant 31-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right ankle pain. The onset of her pain began when she slipped on a patch of ice while taking out the trash. She states that she heard a pop at the time of the injury. The patient reports that she was unable to ambulate on her right ankle initially after the injury; however, she is now able to bear some weight on her right ankle, but she is still limping. The patient rates her pain level as a 6 out of 10. Ms. Diaz describes her pain as constant and throbbing. She reports that her right ankle is warm to the touch. She denies any numbness or tingling in her right foot. The patient has been icing and elevating her right ankle while also utilizing ibuprofen last night and this morning, which did not provide her with any relief. The patient states that she used to play a lot of soccer in high school so she notes that she has had other right foot injuries but not like this.

ASSESSMENT

Right ankle sprain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have advised her to keep her right leg elevated when she is seated. I have also advised her to ice her right ankle 5 times per day for 20 minutes at a time to help with the swelling. I have also recommended that the patient be placed in an Aircast to stabilize the ankle. She will remain non-weight-bearing for 1 to 2 days, we provided her with crutches today, and then she can begin weight-bearing as tolerated.

INSTRUCTIONS

If her pain does not improve over the next week, she will contact the office and we will obtain an MRI.

Her ankle has been elevated but she has kept it elevated since last night. However, she believes that it is worth it to come in today and hopefully be able to walk on it in a day or two. This is her first visit to the hospital since her right ankle fell, which was pretty bad but now it's at approximately a 6. Inpatient reports that they ice their ankle and keep it that way. Their last visit had to help them get into the house and they have since been unable to put a little bit of weight onto it but still think it will be sore for the next couple of weeks. А  

Exam

PHYSICAL EXAM  MSK: Examination of the right ankle reveals ecchymosis along the lateral malleolus lateral parallel to the ankle. No sensation at the base. Tenderness to palpation anoints N NECK. 

Results

RESULTS  X-ray of the right ankle was obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no fracture or bony abnormalities.  

Assessment

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  Right ankle pain.  After reviewing the Patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to his current symptoms. I explained to him that his symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain. He was advised to stay off his ankle for at least one to 2 days, but continues to feel sore for the next couple of weeks. The patient understands and agrees with that. We discussed the diagnosis and treatment plan."

are you doing with your blood sugars and your and your diet and exercise [patient] yeah i i check my sugar two or three times a week most of the time it's in that one twenty to one forty range [doctor] okay [patient] yeah i take my medicine okay my diet is alright you know i could be fifteen pounds lighter that would be alright but [doctor] sure [patient] i i i think the sugar has been okay [doctor] okay we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time i'm looking at your records in epic and it showed that it was you know seven . one so it's it's it's good but it could be better any you know we talked about it controlling your diet or improving your diet and trying to have a balanced meal and not eating some of these sweets and high sugar items how is that going i know you had talked about your wife being a great cook and making cookies and that's hard to stay away from obviously how are things going with that [patient] yeah she still makes cookies and i still eat them but you know we are trying to trying to do better trying to stay away from more of those carbs and focus on you know less carby less sweet stuff [doctor] okay alright yeah that's always a struggle i certainly understand but you know really important with your diabetes just to prevent some of the complications like kidney failure and eye problems and just keep your sugar under balance so i'll order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check that again today and and you know just reemphasizing the controlling your diet and exercise is super important and then we'll have those results back we'll we'll see if we need to make any modifications okay [patient] okay [doctor] for your high blood pressure your blood pressure in the clinic looks pretty good it's about one twenty over seventy right now we have you on norvasc five milligrams once a day how are things going with that are you are you checking that periodically or any issues with that at all [patient] yeah i guess i check it maybe once a week or two or three times a month and it it the vast majority of the time when i check it it's good usually either that one twenty to one thirty over seventy to eighty range i i think the blood pressure's okay [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had any real problems there i i have had some some swelling in my ankles though [doctor] okay is that new or is that been going on for a while [patient] well it it started maybe i do n't know a month or two after i started the norvasc [doctor] okay [patient] and i was just wondering if the two might be related [doctor] yeah i mean certainly it could be it is you know sometimes that medication can cause that so i'll i'll examine you in a second and see if we need to make any modifications okay [patient] okay [doctor] alright so and your anything else bothering you today [patient] no i'm we're doing okay i think [doctor] so let me examine you for a second i'm gon na go ahead and gabriel i'm gon na do my magic exam now let's pretend i i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings as i do my exam and so [patient] these are like my video visit exams [doctor] exactly so your neck exam has no jvd there is no bruits that i can hear your lung exam no rales no wheezing on your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past so i'm not too worried about that otherwise regular rate and rhythm on your heart exam

therapy to help strengthen some of the muscles in your lower back i do n't think you need an x-ray at this stage why do n't we start with physical therapy and the muscle relaxers and the pain

Right knee pain.

HPI:

Ms. Thompson is a 43-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of right knee pain. She states she was trying to change a lightbulb on a ladder, and she twisted her knee when she stumbled and caught herself from falling yesterday. She has been applying ice and taking Ibuprofen without relief.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:

Ibuprofen, digoxin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

Atrial fibrillation.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:

Rhinoplasty.

EXAM

Examination of the right knee shows pain with flexion. Tenderness over the medial joint line. No pain in the calf. Pain with valgus stress. Sensation is intact.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right knee show no obvious signs of acute fracture or dislocation. Mild effusion is noted.

IMPRESSION

Right knee acute medial meniscus sprain.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended a knee brace. She will take Motrin 800 mg, every 6 hours with food, for two weeks. She will use crutches for the next couple of days. She will follow up with me in 1 week for a repeat evaluation. If she is not better at that time, we will obtain an MRI. All questions were answered.

aci,D2N077,"[doctor] hey diana it's good to see you in here so i see that you injured your wrist could you tell me a bit about what happened
[patient] yeah i was walking up and down the stairs i was doing my laundry and i slipped and i tried to catch myself and i put my arms out to catch myself and then all of a sudden i just my wrist started to hurt real bad and it got real swollen
[doctor] wow okay so which wrist are we talking about left or right
[patient] it's my right one of course
[doctor] okay and then have you ever injured this arm before
[patient] no i have not
[doctor] okay alright so on a scale of one to ten how severe is the pain
[patient] gosh it's like a nine
[doctor] wow okay have you done anything to ease it
[patient] yeah i did the ice thing i put ice on it and then i you know i even i have a ace wrap at home i try to do that
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then i took some ibuprofen but it helps a little bit but it's just it's it's just not right
[doctor] okay
[patient] really
[doctor] yeah okay have you sorry i'm trying to think how long ago did this injury happen
[patient] this happened yesterday morning
[doctor] okay
[patient] maybe just you know i just bumped it but
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's just not it's really bad
[doctor] okay no i understand okay so i'm going so you said you were doing laundry
[patient] yes i had my back hit my basket and for some reason this cold started to kinda fall out a little bit i was trying to catch it i missed a step and i just totally
[doctor] okay alright any does the pain extend anywhere
[patient] no not really
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's just really along my wrist
[doctor] okay any numbness any tingling
[patient] a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but just maybe a little bit of tingling
[doctor] okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay
[patient] it does
[doctor] and what about the outside does that hurt as well
[patient] yeah it does
[doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like
[patient] not without extreme pain
[doctor] okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up
[patient] yeah i have a hard time doing that actually
[doctor] alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright and then lateral as well
[patient] yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason
[doctor] alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist
[patient] hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight
[doctor] okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you
[patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all
[doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down
[patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better
[doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to
[patient] i'm sorry
[doctor] pardon what
[patient] a what
[doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace
[patient] okay thank you
[doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay
[patient] when do i have to have the surgery
[doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so what
[patient] how how long do i have to wear that brace

Right wrist injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Diana Scott is a pleasant 61-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right wrist injury. The patient sustained this injury yesterday morning, 05/12/2022, when she slipped on the stairs while carrying a laundry basket. She states she tried to catch herself with her arms outstretched. The patient reports an immediate onset of pain and swelling in her right wrist. She denies any previous injuries to her right arm. The patient rates her pain level as a 9/10. Her pain is aggravated by movement. The patient also reports numbness and tingling in her fingers. She has been icing and wrapping her right wrist with an ACE wrap. The patient has also been taking ibuprofen, which provides some relief. She notes fully extending her arm while resting it on a pillow alleviates some of her pain as well.

The patient is going on vacation in 1 month.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right wrist were taken today. These reveal the fracture appears extra-articular and proximal to the radioulnar joint. Dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree. Dorsal angulation is severe, presenting with a dinner fork deformity. An ulnar styloid fracture is present.

ASSESSMENT

Right wrist Colles fracture.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have discussed with the patient that her x-rays revealed a right wrist Colles fracture. We discussed treatment options and I have recommended that we proceed with a right wrist ORIF and all indicated procedures. We reviewed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. I explained that we should schedule the operation for as soon as possible to ensure adequate healing and to limit malformation of the wrist. I advised that this procedure will require her to be admitted to the hospital for an overnight stay.

In the meantime, the patient will be placed in a thumb spica brace and receive instructions on its proper usage. I have prescribed the patient Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours to treat her pain. We also discussed that her postoperative course will include wearing a brace for 6 weeks. A few weeks after surgery, the patient will initiate formal physical therapy and will attend 3 times per week to strengthen her right wrist. The patient has a 2-week vacation planned in 1 month. I recommended that we consult with her physical therapist to determine if there are exercises she can perform on her own instead of postponing her vacation.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 4 weeks status post surgery to discuss her progress.
", [doctor] hey diana it's good to see you in here so i see that you injured your wrist could you tell me a bit about what happened [patient] yeah i was walking up and down the stairs i was doing my laundry and i slipped and i tried to catch myself and i put my arms out to catch myself and then all of a sudden i just my wrist started to hurt real bad and it got real swollen [doctor] wow okay so which wrist are we talking about left or right [patient] it's my right one of course [doctor] okay and then have you ever injured this arm before [patient] no i have not [doctor] okay alright so on a scale of one to ten how severe is the pain [doctor] wow okay have you done anything to ease it [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] and then i took some ibuprofen but it helps a little bit but it's just it's it's just not right [doctor] okay [patient] really [doctor] yeah okay have you sorry i'm trying to think how long ago did this injury happen [patient] this happened yesterday morning [doctor] okay [patient] maybe just you know i just bumped it but [doctor] okay [patient] yes i had my back hit my basket and for some reason this cold started to kinda fall out a little bit i was trying to catch it i missed a step and i just totally [doctor] okay alright any does the pain extend anywhere [patient] no not really [doctor] okay [patient] it's just really along my wrist [doctor] okay any numbness any tingling [patient] a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] but just maybe a little bit of tingling [doctor] okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright [patient] okay [patient] yes [doctor] okay [patient] it does [patient] yeah it does [doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like [patient] not without extreme pain [doctor] okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up [doctor] alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt [patient] yeah [doctor] alright and then lateral as well [patient] yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason [doctor] alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist [patient] hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight [doctor] okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you [doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down [patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better [doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] pardon what [patient] a what [doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace [patient] okay thank you [doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay [patient] when do i have to have the surgery [doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start

[doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] pardon what [patient] a what [doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace [patient] okay thank you [doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay [patient] when do i have to have the surgery [doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform [patient] okay [doctor] alright so what [patient] how how long do i have to wear that brace [doctor] you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks [patient] six weeks [doctor] yeah so you're gon na you're gon na come in for your surgery we're gon na perform it you're gon na stay overnight and then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime you'll also then go to physical therapy i want you there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of [patient] oof [doctor] these these deform these deformities that really that really kind of hurt is the short version alright no problem any other questions [patient] no well i am going on vacation do i need to cancel it like can i still go even with the i mean after the surgery [doctor] yeah [patient] do it as soon as possible i'm going a vacation in a month so [doctor] okay how long is the vacation [patient] it's only for like a couple weeks [doctor] okay well so you might have to postpone it just because depending on what physical therapy says right if they feel that you can sustain if you can like sustain the exercises while you're gone that if there's something that you can do by yourself then you should be fine but we do wan na give it you said that it's gon na happen in a couple of weeks [patient] no vacation in a month [doctor] okay okay yeah so

Left knee pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Andrea Barnes is a 34-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of left knee pain.

The patient has been experiencing intermittent episodes of pain and sudden instability with ambulation. Her pain is localized deep in her patella and occurs less than once daily. Due to the fleeting nature of these episodes, she has not taken medication and simply braces herself until it passes. She denies any trauma or injury, or ever hearing or feeling a pop in the knee. Her symptoms do not interfere with her daily activities and she does not use a cane.

Regarding her hypertension, it has been several days since she last checked her blood pressure at home, but it was approximately 120/70 mmHg at that time. Her current medications include amlodipine, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide, all of which she takes on a regular basis.

In terms of her diabetes, her fasting morning blood glucose levels have been approximately 130 based on home monitoring. This is slightly higher than usual, even though she has been compliant with metformin and Farxiga. She does try to avoid eating late at night.

PLAN

After reviewing the patients x-rays, I believe there is some arthritis in the knee. I'm going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily. We can consider physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the area to prevent any further issues.

Her hypertension is well controlled with her current medication regimen. She can continue with lisinopril 20 mg once daily. I'm also going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation of the murmur heard on exam.

She has been compliant with metformin as prescribed, but her blood glucose levels have been slightly elevated recently. I'm going to order a lipid panel, as well as a hemoglobin A1c to determine if any adjustments need to be made to her dose of metformin.", [patient] hello [doctor] i understand you're you've come in

else looks good and thank you i know you did a chest x-ray before coming in so on your results for the chest x-ray it does look like you have some mild radiation pneumonitis which basically means some inflammation of the lungs most likely due to the radiation so what does this all mean so for your assessment and plan so for the first diagnosis the first problem of the lung cancer so what we're gon na do is we're gon na continue with the current regimen of your chemotherapy of the cisplacin and the etoside and we're gon na continue with your current dose of radiation at forty five grade and when that's complete we will repeat some imaging and hopefully you know the tumor will shrink down enough that we can remove it surgically okay for problem number two so the radiation pneumonitis so that's what causing that cough as well as some of the shortness of breath i know you're not experiencing it much now so what i'm gon na do for that is actually gon na prescribe you a low dose of prednisone and so that's an will help with the inflammation i'm gon na give you forty milligrams daily for five days and so hopefully that will help reduce the inflammation and so that you can continue with the radiation okay how does that sound so far [patient] that sounds great thank you [doctor] okay and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs but it also in your esophagus as well so what i'm gon na do is prescribe you you're taking the the prednisone i'm also gon na give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids prevent dehydration and any further weight loss [patient] great [doctor] okay any questions for me [patient] i do n't believe so at this time [doctor] okay alright so i'll see you at your next visit [patient] great thank you

RESULTS

An echocardiogram, obtained at an outside facility, was reviewed today. It demonstrates a preserved ejection fraction of 55%. Normal diastolic filling. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. CHF.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient’s recent epsiode resulting in the emergency room visit was likely caused by his dietary indiscretion and uncontrolled hypertension that we have been monitoring.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I reviewed the echocardiogram results with the patient and discussed the importance of following dietary restrictions. I encouraged the patient to take his medication on a consistent basis. I advised him to purchase a scale to weigh himself daily.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue Bumex 2 mg once daily. He was provided with a referral to a nutritionist in consultation for further assistance with his dietary requirements to lower his sodium intake.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This is currently uncontrolled.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the importance of taking his medication on a daily basis. I encouraged the patient to purchase a blood pressure cuff and track his blood pressures.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue Cozaar 100 mg daily as well as the Norvasc 5 mg once daily. I will order a renal artery ultrasound for further evaluation.

3. Systolic ejection murmur.
- Medical Reasoning. Stable.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports use of Tylenol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Gastrointestinal: Reports right-sided abdominal pain and nausea. Denies vomiting
Genitourinary: Reports dysuria and dark colored urine. Denies hematuria.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: No masses or tenderness to palpation. No rebound or guarding. No peritoneal signs. Positive CVA tenderness on the right flank.

RESULTS

Previous CT scan of the abdomen ordered by the patient's PCP is reviewed and demonstrates a 0.5 cm kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Acute nephrolithiasis.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient presents with complaints of right-sided abdominal pain. His previous CT scan was reviewed and demonstrates a 0.5 cm kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter without evidence of hydronephrosis.
- Medical Treatment: I have recommended that he push fluids in order to help facilitate urination to help pass the stone. He will be provided with a strainer to allow us to potentially test the stone if he is able to pass it. I have also prescribed oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain. He can continue to alternate oxycodone with Tylenol. A basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, and urine culture will also be ordered.

INSTRUCTIONS

He will follow up in 1 to 2 weeks. If he is still having symptoms at that time, we will discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy or ureteroscopy. He is to contact me if he is having worsening symptoms over the next week.", [doctor] hi russell how are you what's been going on [patient] well i've been having this sharp pain on the right side of
