Follow-up of chronic problems.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Anna Mitchell is a 44-year-old female with a past medical history significant for arthritis, gout, and reflux, who presents today for follow-up of her chronic problems. It has been about 6 months since I last saw the patient.

The patient reports her arthritis is starting to get better. She has been trying to move her body with pilates and lifting weights. This has helped build up some muscles and her joint pain has reduced. The patient has also continued to attend physical therapy, which she feels has been beneficial.

Ms. Mitchell had an episode of gout of her right first big toe about 2 months ago. She states she is doing well on the allopurinol 100 mg once daily and has had no further flare ups.

Regarding her acid reflux, she was placed on omeprazole 40 mg once a day to help with some of the symptoms she was having. She started to make some dietary modifications, but she still needs to make more progress. She reports episodes of vomiting in the morning. The patient also has abdominal pain and bloating. Her last bowel movement was 2 days ago, and it was normal. She denies blood in her stool.

The patient denies unexplained weight gain or loss, fevers, chills.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Anna Mitchell is a 44-year-old female with a past medical history significant for arthritis, gout, and reflux, who presents today for follow-up of her chronic problems.

Acid reflux with nausea and vomiting.
• Medical Reasoning: She reports episodes of vomiting in the morning, as well as abdominal pain and bloating. She has been compliant with omeprazole and has made a few dietary modifications.
• Additional Testing: We will order an ultrasound of her right upper quadrant, as well as additional labs, to rule out biliary etiology.
• Medical Treatment: Continue omeprazole 40 mg once daily.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with dietary modifications.

Gout.
• Medical Reasoning: Her flares are well controlled on allopurinol.
• Medical Treatment: Continue allopurinol 100 mg once daily. This was refilled today.

Arthritis.
• Medical Reasoning: She is doing well and has remained active since her last visit. Physical therapy has also been beneficial for her. Her right knee x-ray demonstrated residual arthritis but was otherwise normal.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised her to continue pilates and using the knee. She will contact me if she has any issues and we can consider further imaging or intervention at that time.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."," [doctor] hi , anna . how are you ? [patient] i'm doing okay . how are you ?

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Ms. Stephanie Diaz is a 49-year-old female with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure, kidney stones, and prior colonoscopy, who presents today for abnormal labs.

Anemia.
• Medical Reasoning: This is a new issue. Her recent hemoglobin level was low at 8.2, but she denies any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or urinary tract bleeding, as well as any abnormal menstrual bleeding. Her colonoscopy from 3 years ago demonstrated mild diverticulosis.
• Additional Testing: We will order an anemia profile for further evaluation.
• Specialist Referrals: We will refer her back to gastroenterology for repeat evaluation with possible endoscopy and colonoscopy.

Congestive heart failure.
• Medical Reasoning: She has noticed some lower extremity edema. Her echocardiogram from 6 months ago demonstrated a reduced ejection fraction of 45%, as well as moderate mitral regurgitation.
• Medical Treatment: We will initiate Lasix 40 mg once daily, and continue with Toprol 50 mg daily and lisinopril 10 mg daily.
• Patient Education and Counseling: She should continue to limit her sodium intake. I advised her to monitor her daily weights and notify me if these start to increase.

Kidney stones.
• Medical Reasoning: She as asymptomatic denies any recent flare ups.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with dietary modifications and proper hydration. She will contact me with any questions or concerns.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

[doctor] okay . all right . well , let's start with your diabetes . so , your diet's been good ?
[patient] um , for the most part , but we have been traveling all over to different sports tournaments for the kids , so it was , uh , a weekend of , uh , eating on the go , crumby junk food , pizza , and did n't really stick to the diet , so that was a bit of an adjustment .
[doctor] okay . all right . um , but , ha- ha- have you ... let's just talk about your review of systems . have you had any dizziness , lightheadedness , fever , chills ?
[patient] running up and down the stairs , it was pretty warm , so i did feel a little bit lightheaded , and i did get a little dizzy , but i thought it was just the heat and the fatigue .
[doctor] okay . any chest pain , shortness of breath , or belly pain ?
[patient] shortness of breath . no belly pain though .
[doctor] okay . all right . and , how about any joint pain or muscle aches ?
[patient] uh , my knees hurt a little bit from running up and down , and maybe picking up the boxes , but nothing out of the ordinary .

[patient] only when it seems to go over about 85 degrees out . that's when i really feel it , so that's when i've been using it . if it's a nice , cool , dry day , i really do n't use the inhaler .

[patient] i was taking it regularly , but i've kind of weened myself off of it . i thought i felt a little bit better , but i think , uh , i , i kinda go through battles with depression every so often .
[doctor] okay . all right . are you interested in resuming the medication , or would you like to try a different one ?
[patient] i , maybe adjusting what i'm currently taking , maybe l- less of a dose so i do n't feel the side effects as much , but i , i'm willing to try something different .

[doctor] okay , so your , your pfts , that , those are your breathing studies , and those look quite good , so i know that you're wheezing right now , but , um , you know , i think that we can add , add , um , a regimen to that to help , to help you with your , um , exacerbations during the , the summer months , okay ?

[doctor] and , it's just is all just from your asthma . so , you know , my impression of you at this time , you know , from a diabetes standpoint , let's , let's increase the metformin to 1,000 mg twice a day . um , and , we will get a repeat hemoglobin a1c in three months , and i want you to continue to monitor your blood sugars at home .
[doctor] from an asthma standpoint , let's continue you on the albuterol , two puffs , uh , every four to six hours as needed , and we'll add symbicort , two puffs twice a day during the summer , to kind of help prevent those exacerbations . and then , from a depression standpoint , we'll go ahead and start you on a different medication , zoloft , um , 25 mg once a day and see how you tolerate that . does that sound okay ?
[patient] perfect .
[doctor] all right . so , the nurse will be in soon , and she'll get you situated with all of that , okay ?

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Joseph Smith is a 59-year-old male who presents for a routine follow up of his chronic problem. The patient reports he has been doing well with his diabetes and asthma. He states the medications he is currently taking are helping manage these issues. His depression is not tolerating the Prozac 20 mg he was taking daily before diagnosis. There are reports of bilateral expiratory wheezing, as well as shortness of breath, and he reports running up and down the stairs for exercise. This may be due to the severe pollen damage experienced in his state of state last year. While asthma is under control for the most part, he adds that there have been exacerbations during the summer months. When asked about how often he uses his inhaler, the patient estimates that approximately 2 hours per inhalation is his usual rate. For depression, this has not been an issue over the past year, but he does admit to managing through his depression at 20mg per day. Regarding his pneumonia, it was a weekend of traveling all over to different sports tournaments, eating on the go, crumby junk food, pizza, where he fevers a little bit from the excitement and lack of nutrition. Denies signs of fever, chills, or abdominal pain. As for his joint pain or muscle aches, he suspects it is just the heat and fatigue he experiences while running. They do not appear to be significant with respect to his knees. From an asthma standpoint, reports 2 puffs every 4-6 hours as needed. With depression, reports 0 to 1mg prozac weekly.

[doctor] um , and going upstairs or downstairs , does that bother you at all ?
[patient] yeah , well , i do n't have stairs , but um , i would avoid that at all costs .
[doctor] okay . um , it looks like you had a history of atopic eczema in your past ?
[patient] yes . yes , i have eczema .
[doctor] okay . and you take uh- uh , fluocinonide for that ?

Ms. Peterson is a 43-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of right leg pain. She states she was bowling and hit her leg with the ball and fell. She developed mild bruising. She denies swelling. She has been walking very carefully. She is alternating Tylenol and ibuprofen. She has a history of atopic eczema and takes Fluocinonide topical cream for it. She has a history of colectomy following diverticulosis.

EXAM

Examination of the right leg shows significant tenderness to the lateral aspect of the right upper leg. No pain or tenderness with flexion or extension of the lower leg.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right lower extremity is normal, no fractures or dislocations.

IMPRESSION

Right leg contusion.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended Mobic 15 mg once a day. She will use ice for pain. She will follow up as needed.

virtscribe,D2N029,"[doctor] next patient is sophia jackson , mrnr472348 . she's a 57 year old female who is here for a surgical consult . her dermatologist referred her . she biopsied a 0.7 millimeter lesion which was located on right inferior back . pathology came back as melanoma .
[doctor] mrs. jackson , it's good to meet you .
[patient] likewise , wish it were under better circumstances .
[doctor] yeah , i hear your dermatologist sent you to me 'cause she found a melanoma ?
[patient] yes , that's what the biopsy said .
[doctor] okay and when did you first notice the spot ?
[patient] my mom noticed it when i was visiting her last month .
[doctor] i see . and so you went to the dermatologist on april 10th to get it checked out , right ?
[patient] yes , i wanted to be extra cautious because skin cancer does run in my family .
[doctor] well i'm really glad you took it seriously and got it checked . who in your family has had skin cancer , and do you know if it was melanoma or was it basal cell or squamous cell ?
[patient] my mom and her sister , i think they both had melanoma .
[doctor] okay . do you have any other types of cancer in the family , like breast or ovarian ?
[patient] my grandfather had pancreatic cancer .
[doctor] okay , and was that your mom or dad's father ?
[patient] mother's .
[doctor] okay . and , um , have you personally had any skin spots in the past that you got checked out and they were cancerous or precancerous ?
[patient] no , this was the first time i've been to a dermatologist . um , but my primary care doctor looks over all of my moles every year at my physical and has n't said , um , he's concerned about any of 'em before .
[doctor] good- good . uh , let's go over your medical history from your chart . i have that you're not taking any medications and do n't have any health problems listed , but that you're allergic to augmentin , is that right ?
[patient] yes , that's correct .
[doctor] okay , and for social history can you tell me what you do for work ?
[patient] i own an auto repair shop .
[doctor] okay and have you ever been a smoker ?
[patient] yeah , i still smoke from time to time . i started that awful habit in my teens and it's hard to break , but i'm trying .
[doctor] i'm glad you're trying to quit . uh , what about your surgical history , have you had any surgeries ?
[patient] i had gall bladder and appendix .
[doctor] okay , great , we can get your chart up to date now , thank you . and other than the melanoma , how has your health been , any unintentional weight changes , headaches , fatigue , nausea , vomiting , vision changes ?
[patient] no , i've been feelin' great .
[doctor] good . well let me take a look at your back here where they did the biopsy if you do n't mind .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] okay , i'm gon na describe it in medical jargon what i'm seeing here , so that the recording can capture it , but you and i are gon na go over it together in just a moment , okay ?
[patient] okay , that's fine .
[doctor] all right , so on the right inferior back there's a one centimeter shave biopsy site , including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation . there's no intrinsic or satellite lesions , no other suspicious moles , no axillary , cervical , or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy . there is a soft lymph node in the right groin , but it's nontender , otherwise normal exam .
[doctor] okay , you can sit up . um , so what i was saying there is that i see your biopsy site , but i do n't see any other s- , um , skin lumps or bumps that look suspicious . uh , i also felt your lymph nodes to see if any of them felt abnormal . there is one in the right groin that felt slightly abnormal . it's very likely nothing , but i do want you to have an ultrasound of that area to confirm it's nothing , um , and , you know , make sure it's nothing that we need to worry about . uh , the reason we're being extra cautious is that melanoma can very rarely metastasize to the lymph nodes . the ultrasound can tell us if we need to look into this further .
[patient] okay , i should n't worry too much then ?
[doctor] no , i have a low suspicion that it will show anything .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so assuming that the ultrasound is normal , the treatment for you melanoma is to cut out the area where the lesion was . with lesions that are 0.7 millimeters or less , um , and that's what we recommend , and yours was exactly 0.7 millimeters . if it were any bigger , we would have had to do a more complex surgery . but what i recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision , excuse me , excision , meaning that i will make a long incision and then cut out an area a bit wider than your current biopsy site . the incision is long because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely . you'll have a fairly long scar from the incision .
[patient] okay , that is fine with me , i ca n't see back there anyways .
[doctor] yeah , your wife can tell you what it looks like and she may need to help care for the incision at it , as it heals . um , but since we're , we are n't doing the more complex surgery , i actually do n't need to see you back unless you want to check in with me or have any problems . however , it is very important that you continue to follow up with your dermatologist regularly so she can monitor you . uh , your dermatologist will check that this one does n't come back , but she'll also check for other lesions that look suspicious . uh , unfortunately , since you've had one melanoma , you're at a higher risk of developing another one somewhere else .
[patient] yeah , she did say she wants to see me back .
[doctor] good , and i'm sure she's already told you , but it's very important that you apply sunscreen anytime and anywhere that your skin is exposed to sunlight .
[patient] yeah , she definitely went over that , um , several times with me .
[doctor] good . other than that , i think that's all for me . um , we'll get you set up for the ultrasound , the procedure . do you have any questions for me ?
[patient] um , no i ca n't think of any at this time .
[doctor] okay , my nurse will be in to get you scheduled , so sit tight . it was very good to meet you .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sophia Jackson is a very pleasant 57-year-old female who presents for a surgical consult for melanoma of the right inferior back. She was referred by her dermatologist who biopsied the 0.7 mm lesion on 04/10 and diagnosed the melanoma. The lesion was initially noticed by the patient’s mother when she was visiting her last month. Mrs. Jackson denies a personal history of atypical nevi and reports that she has annual mole checks by her primary care provider at her physicals. She has never seen a dermatologist prior to last month. There is a family history of melanoma in her mother and maternal aunt. The patient reports that she has been in her usual state of health with no unintentional weight changes, headaches, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, or vision changes.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient presents today with newly diagnosed melanoma. The biopsy revealed an intermediate thickness melanoma. On examination today, there is a right inguinal lymph node with slightly atypical consistency. I recommended an ultrasound to rule out metastatic disease. If the ultrasound is normal, the patient is a candidate for a wide local excision with a 1-2 cm margin. Primary closure should be possible, but skin graft closure may be needed. The relationship between tumor histology and prognosis and treatment was carefully reviewed. The need for follow up according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines was reviewed. We also reviewed the principles of sun avoidance, skin self-examination, and the ABCDE’s of mole surveillance.

[doctor] mrs. jackson , it's good to meet you . [patient] likewise , wish it were under better circumstances . [doctor] yeah , i hear your dermatologist sent you to me 'cause she found a melanoma ? [patient] yes , that's what the biopsy said . [doctor] okay and when did you first notice the spot ? [patient] my mom noticed it when i was visiting her last month . [patient] yes , i wanted to be extra cautious because skin cancer does run in my family . [doctor] well i'm really glad you took it seriously and got it checked . who in your family has had skin cancer , and do you know if it was melanoma or was it basal cell or squamous cell ? [patient] my mom and her sister , i think they both had melanoma . [doctor] okay . do you have any other types of cancer in the family , like breast or ovarian ? [patient] my grandfather had pancreatic cancer . [doctor] okay , and was that your mom or dad's father ? [patient] mother's . [doctor] okay . and , um , have you personally had any skin spots in the past that you got checked out and they were cancerous or precancerous ? [patient] no , this was the first time i've been to a dermatologist . um , but my primary care doctor looks over all of my moles every year at my physical and has n't said , um , he's concerned about any of 'em before . [doctor] good- good . uh , let's go over your medical history from your chart . i have that you're not taking any medications and do n't have any health problems listed , but that you're allergic to augmentin , is that right ? [patient] yes , that's correct . [patient] i own an auto repair shop . [doctor] okay and have you ever been a smoker ? [patient] yeah , i still smoke from time to time . i started that awful habit in my teens and it's hard to break , but i'm trying . [doctor] i'm glad you're trying to quit . uh , what about your surgical history , have you had any surgeries ? [patient] i had gall bladder and appendix . [doctor] okay , great , we can get your chart up to date now , thank you . and other than the melanoma , how has your health been , any unintentional weight changes , headaches , fatigue , nausea , vomiting , vision changes ? [patient] no , i've been feelin' great . [doctor] good . well let me take a look at your back here where they did the biopsy if you do n't mind . [patient] sure . [doctor] okay , i'm gon na describe it in medical jargon what i'm seeing here , so that the recording can capture it , but you and i are gon na go over it together in just a moment , okay ? [patient] okay , that's fine . [doctor] all right , so on the right inferior back there's a one centimeter shave biopsy site , including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation . there's no intrinsic or satellite lesions , no other suspicious moles , no axillary , cervical , or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy . there is a soft lymph node in the right groin , but it's nontender , otherwise normal exam . [doctor] okay , you can sit up . um , so what i was saying there is that i see your biopsy site , but i do n't see any other s- , um , skin lumps or bumps that look suspicious . uh , i also felt your lymph nodes to see if any of them felt abnormal . there is one in the right groin that felt slightly abnormal . it's very likely nothing , but i do want you to have an ultrasound of that area to confirm it's nothing , um , and , you know , make sure it's nothing that we need to worry about . uh , the reason we're being extra cautious is that melanoma can very rarely metastasize to the lymph nodes . the ultrasound can tell us if we need to look into this further . [doctor] no , i have a low suspicion that it will show anything . [patient] okay , good . [doctor] so assuming that the ultrasound is normal , the treatment for you melanoma is to cut out the area where the lesion was . with lesions that are 0.7 millimeters or less , um , and that's what we recommend , and yours was exactly 0.7 millimeters . if it were any bigger , we would have had to do a more complex surgery . but what i recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision , excuse me , excision , meaning that i will make a long incision and then cut out an area a bit wider than your current biopsy site . the incision is long because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely . you'll have a fairly long scar from the incision . [patient] okay , that is fine with me , i ca n't see back there anyways . [doctor] yeah , your wife can tell you what it looks like and she may need to help care for the incision at it , as it heals . um , but since we're , we are n't doing the more complex surgery , i actually do n't need to see you back unless you want to check in with me or have any problems . however , it is very important that you continue to follow up with your dermatologist regularly so she can monitor you . uh , your dermatologist will check that this one does n't come back , but she'll also check for other lesions that look suspicious . uh , unfortunately , since you've had one melanoma , you're at a higher risk of developing another one somewhere else . [patient] yeah , she did say she wants to see me back . [doctor] good , and i'm sure she's already told you , but it's very important that you apply sunscreen anytime and anywhere that your skin is exposed to sunlight . [patient] yeah , she definitely went over that , um , several times with me . [doctor] good . other than that , i think that's all for me . um , we'll get you set up for the ultrasound , the procedure . do you have any questions for me ?

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Ms. Sophia Jackson is a 57-year-old female who presents today for a surgical consult. Her dermatologist referred her to me after she discovered a 0.7 millimeter lesion which was located on right inferior back. When did she first notice the spot?  She stated that her mom noticed it when she was visiting her last month. The patient also commented that skin cancer does run in her family. She believes that melanoma may have been seen in the past and inquired about other skin spots. This was her first time undergoing surgery, but her primary care physician has looked over all of her moles every year and has not expressed any concern before. In her case, she did feel a slight bump or irritation and ordered an ultrasound to rule out metastatic disease. At this time, the pathology analysis will be performed to confirm whether or not the lesions are cancerous or whether they are superficial and if so, they will lead to a recommendation of wide local excision with a 1 to 2 centimeter margin. Skin graft closure is possible with primary closure and skin graft surgery is required with the larger lesions that are larger and radial growth is not identified. Mitotic features, less than 1 meter squared. Abnormalities, no infiltrating, Perineural, Cervical, or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.  ","CHIEF COMPLAINT  Right inferior back melanoma.

The patient requested an ultrasound due to the need for follow-up, but she did say she wants to see me back. This was the first time she was to a dermatological office. Her family has had skin cancer in the past and has not said that they have any illnesses listed as cancerous or precancerous. Mrs.jackson also informed her dermatologist that she is allergic to augmentin, which she denies has any health problems listed. In her experience with smoking, she has broken a habit of habit in her teens and is trying to quit.  Regarding his health, Mr. Jackson notes that his mom noticed the spot when he was visiting her last month. He denies any unintentional weight changes, headaches, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, vision changes, or injuries that resulted in weight loss or nausea. His health has been feelin' great, and he is glad you took it seriously and got the biopsy results so that you can continue to follow up with your Dermatologyologist regularly and have a successful procedure on behalf of the patient).

Melanoma. • Medical Reasoning: The patient's dermatologist referred her for a repeat biopsy to rule out metastatic disease. Her pathology results were reviewed and the diagnosis was mademalignant melanoma, invasive, superficial spreading, Clark level 4, Breslow thickness 0.7 millimeters, radial growth phase present, Vertical growth Phase not identified, mitotic features, less than 1 millimeter squared.  2. Family history: Melanism does run in the family. I reviewed the photo of the lesion which showed an asymmetric black and brown nevus with central a melanotic component and irregular border. We discussed the significance of this and advised the patient to continue to apply sunscreen whenever and anywhere that her skin is exposed to sunlight. She is also advised to self-examine regularly for skin spots or bumps that look suspicious. Finally, a thorough ultrasound was performed to determine if the surrounding dermal dermis is affected. The pathology came back as non-hodosiene growth factor 2 negative. Pathology was also reviewed to confirm the absence of intrinsic lesions. There is a soft lymph node located right inferior groin, but it is nontender, otherwise normal exam.

CHIEF COMPLAINT  Melanoma.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Ms. Sophia Jackson is a 57-year-old female who presents today for a surgical consult. Her dermatologist referred her to me after she discovered a 0.7 millimeter lesion which was located on right inferior back. When did she first notice the spot?  She stated that her mom noticed it when she was visiting her last month. The patient also commented that skin cancer does run in her family. She believes that melanoma may have been seen in the past and inquired about other skin spots. This was her first time undergoing surgery, but her primary care physician has looked over all of her moles every year and has not expressed any concern before. In her case, she did feel a slight bump or irritation and ordered an ultrasound to rule out metastatic disease. At this time, the pathology analysis will be performed to confirm whether or not the lesions are cancerous or whether they are superficial and if so, they will lead to a recommendation of wide local excision with a 1 to 2 centimeter margin. Skin graft closure is possible with primary closure and skin graft surgery is required with the larger lesions that are larger and radial growth is not identified. Mitotic features, less than 1 meter squared. Abnormalities, no infiltrating, Perineural, Cervical, or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.

History of right ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sophia Brown is a 75 y.o. female who presents today for a new patient evaluation due to her history of right DCIS. She is doing well but wishes to establish care today for continued monitoring.

The patient underwent a screening mammogram in 10/2019 and was found to have a calcification in the right breast. She then had a right breast ultrasound on 11/03/2019 which revealed a mass at the 2 o’clock position, 11 cm from the nipple, in the retroareolar region. The report states the mass was 0.4 by 2.0 by 3.0 centimeters. She subsequently had an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on 12/05/2019 and pathology results revealed grade 2 ER-positive, PR-positive DCIS. The patient then had a lumpectomy with lymphadenectomy performed on 01/20/2020. The tumor was 8 mm with negative margins and the 5 lymph nodes removed were all benign. Pathology from the tumor confirmed DCIS. Her lumpectomy was followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Endocrine therapy was also offered but the patient declined. She has since had a mammogram in 01/2021 which was normal. The patient also reports that she performs self-breast exams regularly at home.

Mrs. Brown is a G5P5 female and estimates that her last menstrual period was approximately 30 years ago. She is not currently and has never been on hormone replacement therapy.

The patient’s last colonoscopy was done in 2018. She had a sigmoid polypectomy at that time and pathology showed a tubular adenoma.

Her cholesterol was recently noted to be elevated and the patient reports that she is exercising and reducing fatty food intake accordingly. This is being followed by her primary care provider.

[doctor] hello , ms. brown . [patient] hi . yes , that's me . [patient] you as well . [doctor] so , you've come to see me today because you had a right breast lumpectomy last year . is that right ? [patient] yes . on january 20th , 2020 . [doctor] okay . and how have you been since then ? any problems or concerns ? [patient] sounds good . [doctor] great . so , i have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in october 2019 . was that just a normal screening mammogram , or was it done because you felt a lump ? [patient] it was just a normal one you're supposed to get every so often . [doctor] i see . and then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on november 3rd , 2019 , which revealed a mass at the two o'clock position , 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroareolar region . the report states the mass was point four by two by three centimeters . [patient] yes , that sounds right . hard to remember now , though . [doctor] based on those results , they decided to do an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on december 5th , 2019 . pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade two , er positive , pr positive , dcis , or ductal carcinoma in situ . [patient] yes . unfortunately . [doctor] i know . scary stuff . but you had a lumpectomy on january 20th , 2020 , which removed the eight millimeter tumor and margins were negative . the pathology confirmed dcis . looks like they also removed 5 lymph nodes , which , thankfully , were negative for malignancy . that's great ! [doctor] and your last mammogram was in january 2021 ? and that was normal . [patient] yes . [doctor] okay . so , i feel like i have a good grasp of what's been going on with you now . and you're here today to establish care with me so i can continue to follow you and make sure you're doing well , right ?

[doctor] okay , yes , i see that report now . one polyp in the sigmoid colon which had a benign tubular adenoma . okay . and when was your last menstrual period ? [patient] gosh . it was probably around 30 years ago . [patient] yes . and they're all having kids of their own now , so it's getting even bigger . [patient] it is . [doctor] did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations ? [patient] really , i did not . [doctor] okay . so for the record , that's g5 p5 . and now that you're post-menopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ? [patient] my primary care doctor gave me the option years ago but i decided against it . [patient] okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they've said , excuse me , the back and knee pain are age-related . and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis , but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication . [patient] that's correct . [patient] yes , and that's all . [doctor] okay . so for your medical history , it's high cholesterol and stage 0 er/pr positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . any surgeries other than the lumpectomy ? [patient] i did have my tubes tied after my last baby , but that's all . [patient] none . [doctor] excellent . i have that you're allergic to penicillin . any other allergies ? [patient] nope , just penicillin . [doctor] okay . i think that covers it . hop up here and let me take a look at you . [doctor] okay , so let's use the normal new patient exam template . only change to make is the breast exam . there are no palpable masses , however , there is skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes . [doctor] in the result section , note that her ecog performance status today is zero . [doctor] do you have ... did you have radiation after the lumpectomy ? [patient] i did . we also talked about endocrine therapy , but i decided against that . [doctor] okay . so your exam looks good , no masses , just some skin changes from that radiation . now , let's go over the plan for you . [patient] okay , sounds good . [doctor] as you know , you've had dcis which we'll list in my note as stage zero , er/pr positive , invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . your status post-lumpectomy with removal of five lymph nodes that were benign . you also had , um , radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy . today's clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrence with the dcis or other malignancy and your mammogram in january , 2021 was also negative for recurrence and malignancy .

Right hip pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elizabeth Reyes is a 56-year-old female who presents for the evaluation of pain in her right hip and groin region. Her symptoms started on 02/2020 and has progressively worsened. She is employed as an RN and notes that her symptoms began while she was working and walking around the infusion room at Johnson. Initially the pain would only happen when she took a step back, but the pain has progressed and now occurs with any type of movement involving her right hip and groin. She describes that her hip will sometimes “catch” when she moves, causing her to fall on occasion. The pain improves when she is still and stops moving. She rates her pain as 2-7/10.

Starting in 2018, the patient intentionally lost 110 pounds through Weight Watchers. She has maintained the weight loss and her weight has been stabile for the past 1 year. She has a history of several bulging discs, but the pain has significantly reduced due to her weight loss. Today, she reports no back pain.

Musculoskeletal
Extremities: No bilateral ankle edema or calf tenderness.
Examination of gait: Heel-walk and toe-walk are intact.
Cervical spine exam: No tenderness is elicited. Range of motion is full in all planes without pain. Spurling's test is negative.
Lumbar spine exam: Range of motion is decreased in extension and lateral flexion without pain. No tenderness is elicited in the midline.
Sacroiliac joint exam: Bilateral sacroiliac joints are nontender to palpation.
Bilateral hip exam: Range of motion is decreased in the right hip with pain in the groin on internal and external rotation. Resisted right hip flexion causes pain in the right groin region. Bilateral trochanteric regions are nontender to palpation.

Neurological
Motor bulk and tone are normal in both lower extremities. Motor strength testing reveals no focal motor weakness in the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ throughout. No focal sensory deficit is noted.

RESULTS

MR arthrogram of the right hip completed on 06/03/2021 reveals evidence of high-grade chondromalacia involving the anterosuperior right acetabulum with subchondral marrow edema and cyst formation.

ASSESSMENT

• Right hip degenerative joint disease.

PLAN

I discussed the clinical and radiological findings with the patient. Treatment options discussed are low impact exercises, use of analgesics as needed, and use of a cane to offload the right hip. She would like to proceed with a cortisone injection into her right hip joint. We will administer the injection today. I reviewed the procedure in detail, including the risks of the injection related to the use of steroid in the COVID setting. She understands the risks and would like to proceed with the injection.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule a follow up appointment in 3 months to assess her pain. If needed, a second injection may be administered.

- Auscultation of Heart: Stable 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Trace lower extremity edema.

RESULTS

Echocardiogram reveals a preserved ejection fraction of 55%, abnormal diastolic filling, and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Congestive heart failure.
- Medical Reasoning: This appears to have been caused by dietary indiscretion and uncontrolled hypertension.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue making dietary modifications, including limiting her sodium intake. She could try keeping a food diary, as previously discussed, to log her diet and associated blood pressure readings. I also advised her to monitor her weight daily and contact me if she gains 3 pounds in 2 days.
- Medical Treatment: Continue with Bumex 2 mg once daily. Referral placed for consult with a nutritionist for education and recommendations regarding her diet.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This has been poorly controlled due to inconsistent compliance with medication and dietary indiscretion.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed dietary modifications as noted above.
- Medical Treatment: She can continue on Cozaar 100 mg daily and Norvasc 5 mg once daily. Renal artery ultrasound ordered to rule out any issues such as renal artery stenosis.

3. Kidney disease.
- Medical Treatment: Labs will be ordered to assess her response to new medications.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

Left wrist and hand pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

George Lewis is a pleasant 57-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of left wrist and hand pain. He reports an onset of a few months ago but denies any specific injury. However, the patient notes he often engages in repetitive motions while performing his work duties. His symptoms are worse at night, and he wakes with numbness in the bilateral hands. He experiences numbness in all fingers, but states it is the most noticeable in the left thumb and index finger. He affirms intermittent numbness in the left little finger. For relief, he shakes his hands upon waking. The patient also experiences weakness in his left hand. He reports he drops objects and explains “I have a hard time feeling it.”

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient denies a history of rheumatoid arthritis.

SOCIAL HISTORY

He works in landscaping. He reports consuming 1 to 2 beers on weekends.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left wrist and hand pain. Denies right hand pain.
Neurological: Reports numbness in bilateral hands and fingers, and left hand weakness.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NEURO: Decreased sensation in the right thumb and index finger.
MSK: Examination of the bilateral hands: Grip strength is less on the left in comparison to the right. Positive Tinel sign bilaterally.

ASSESSMENT

Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's clinical history and examination today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding treatment options for his current symptoms. I discussed the importance of activity modification and encouraged the patient to limit active repetitive motions while working for the next 2 weeks. I also recommended that he wear a wrist splint to provide increased support. I advised him to take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours. Additionally, I recommended we obtain an EMG of the bilateral upper extremities to evaluate for carpal tunnel syndrome. The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks when the EMG results are available for review. If at that time his symptoms have not improved with these conservative measures, we will discuss further treatment options including additional diagnostic testing or possible surgical intervention.

The patient states he understands and is in agreement with the plan. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction.

[patient] yeah same thing [doctor] same thing okay so you do have a bilateral positive tinel's sign so so here's here's where i'm at i think your your diagnosis is beginning to have some bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome usually we see that with repetitive actions such as the landscaping the heavy labor and you you know your your clinical exam and and history sound like it's a carpal tunnel syndrome i do want to order so where are we gon na go from here i would like to order a a study it's called an emg where it it measures some of that electrical impulses down into your fingers we will follow up with that but as far as your treatment so the treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is really some activity modification now i know you are a landscaper is there any way that you could be work to have some lighter work during the time [patient] i suppose i could try to pass it off to some of my other employes and delegate [doctor] okay that would be good so that's i i just want you to kinda eliminate that the active repetitive motions that you're doing all the time just for a couple weeks i'm also gon na give you a wrist splint to wear and that should help and i'd like you to take ibuprofen six hundred milligrams every six hours and then i wan na see you back here in the office in two weeks and in that two week period i think we're gon na see if there's need for any other intervention if i need to do more diagnostic testing or if there is a possibly looking at a surgical intervention to release that pressure that's on the nerves in that hand does that sound like a a good plan for you [patient] yeah it sounds like a good first start [doctor] okay okay so i i just just off off the record here what kind of what do what do you specialize in landscaping is your company do [patient] mostly like yard work and maintenance flower beds not really designing just up keep [doctor] okay yeah i'm looking for a landscape designer i need somebody to put in some elaborate walkways back through the backyard so yeah we can do stuff like that i mean if you have an idea what you want i think that's easy [patient] okay [doctor] you know if you're looking for like some [patient] backyard elasis rehab remodel that's i mean i suppose we could do we have n't done things like that in a while because we're busy enough with just the up key but it's something to explore [doctor] okay yeah i may have to keep that in mind because i do wan na do some of that so let's listen i'm gon na get my my nurse in here to discharge you do you have any other questions for me before we end this [patient] no i think it's all clear i appreciate it [doctor] okay take care and i'll look forward to see you in two weeks [patient] very good appreciate your time,"CHIEF

mild posterior paraspinal muscular tenderness in the cervical spine and in bilateral trapezius musculature as well and some tightness in those muscles as well and otherwise on your exam let's see your

about that but how about your metformin are you still taking the five hundred milligrams once a day no actually it looks like we increased your metformin to five hundred milligrams twice a day last

your exercise would you say or what [patient] yes it has [patient] not lately [doctor] being down being down here in florida we got ta get get some golf in so hey did you see the masters by the way a

yeah yeah that's great well we'll we'll get you feeling better and get you back out there and now are you still working a lot on the computer ac or [patient] i am [doctor] carolyn okay yeah you're still working a lot on the computer for work okay are you taking breaks every hour or so you know get up stand around walk stand walk around that can be helpful [patient] no i really do n't get the opportunity to [doctor] hmmm okay understood alright well listen let's go ahead and examine you okay so so on your physical exam your physical exam is pretty normal unremarkable for the most part and you know few things a few exceptions so first of all on your heent exam your eye exam your extraocular motions are intact without pain you have a funduscopic exam that shows no papilledema that's good that just means there's no swelling in the back of your eye and on your neck exam you do have some posterior mild posterior paraspinal muscular tenderness in the cervical spine and in bilateral trapezius musculature as well and some tightness in those muscles as well and otherwise on your exam let's see your heart exam on your heart exam you have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam so it just means i hear some sounds in your heart as it's beating and i'm not too worried about that we'll watch that and otherwise normal heart exam and and your physical examination otherwise is normal and unremarkable and so now let's talk about my assessment and your plan so carolyn for your first problem of the headache i do think that you have a tension type headache and i think this because you've got some tension and tightness in your paraspinal muscles meaning the muscles around your neck and your shoulders and you know working at the computer i think is contributing to this and also probably the stress so you can continue to take that tylenol for the pain i'm also gon na give you a mild muscle relaxant i'll write you for flexeril five milligrams three times a day and you can take that that will help relax those muscles in your neck and that should help with the symptoms i want you to come back or give us a call if the headaches become more severe or suddenly worsen or you develop a fever but i do n't think that this is a a sign of a stroke or any bleeding in your brain or anything like that i think it's more related to tightness in your muscles in your neck now for your second problem of your diabetes mellitus let's continue you on the metformin five hundred milligrams i am going to order a hemoglobin a1c and also a cbc and a chem-12 to check some of your blood tests blood chemistries and so forth and we will continue you on the metformin i do want you to check your blood sugars daily and that will be very helpful so when you come back in a month i want you to bring those numbers with you we can talk about it again and please do try to get back into your exercise routine that's really gon na help you keep those blood sugars under control as well okay so how does that sound for a plan any other questions for me [patient] well would it so only call if if it gets worse or not any better [doctor] yeah that that just right but also let's set up an appointment in four weeks and i wan na see you back in four weeks if it's not if the headache is not better within the next few days with this flexeril then you can give us a call and and get back in later this week or early next but definitely if things get worse give us a call sooner and you know i meant to ask you on i wanted to ask if you had a history of any any trauma meaning have you hit your head or you have n't fallen hit your head or anything like that have you [patient] no no i think it's just stress [doctor] okay alright understood okay great well then i'll see you back in a month if not before okay you take care of yourself nice seeing you [patient] thank you [doctor] sure,"CHIEF COMPLAINT  Headache.

- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No expiratory wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate. 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.

Hematology/Lymphatic/Immunology

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Nicotine dependence.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has a long history of smoking cigarettes. He is currently smoking 1.5 packs per day. He is highly motivated to cease smoking as he is preparing to become a father.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I applaud the patient on making this first step to stop smoking. I reassured him that with absolute 100% certainty that I will be with him every step of the way. I explained to the patient that stress can often be a trigger for smoking. He received handouts today for common smoking triggers. I advised him to be watchful and monitor his stress level, not only regarding work, but also his impending fatherhood. The patient and I discussed coping mechanisms for when he encounters stressful situations. I encouraged him to maintain his gym routine, engage in meditation, and try adding in yoga to help further reduce his stress levels. We discussed additional cessation aids.
- Medical Treatment: The patient has chosen his birthday, as a quit date. On that day, I am going to start him with a 21 mg nicotine patch, and the goal will be to decrease that over time. We will work together to decrease the dosage of the nicotine patch, so there are not necessarily any hard dates in mind. I recommend he change the patch location each day as that will help reduce or avoid any skin irritation that can occur if he re-uses the same location repeatedly.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that continuing to follow a healthy diet and perform regular exercise will help to maintain his blood glucose levels.
- Medical Treatment: We will continue to monitor his type 2 diabetes. Hemoglobin A1c is ordered to be completed by his next visit in 2 weeks.

3. History of gout.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable with medication.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised him to continue to watch for foods that will exacerbate his uric acid levels.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue his allopurinol.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

Results

RESULTS  X-rays of the gloglobin A1c were obtained today. These reveal no evidence of smoking.  

Assessment

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  1. nicotine dependence. • Medical Reasoning: I advised the patient on making this first step to stop smoking, and I encouraged her to monitor her stress level not only about work but also to watch any stress you will be experiencing around the birth of your new child.  2. History of history of gout. I recommended next monday as a quit date and on that day i will start you with a twenty one milligram nicotine patch. The patient understands and agrees with the recommended dosage. She will order a hemoglobin A1c for her next blood draw since i'll see her in 2 weeks and we will talk about that when you come back in now for more blood draws. 3. Hypertension: We discussed the importance of changing the patch location each day and that's going to help reduce or avoid that skin irritation that can occur if you use the same location over and over again. We also see further need to discuss any handouts you received today for common smoking triggers  Patient Agreements: It's fantastic that you're following this process and planning and"

New patient evaluation of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer.

FAMILY HISTORY

The patient was adopted and has no knowledge of any family history.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports unintentional weight loss
Gastrointestinal: Reports abdominal pain and constipation. Denies vomiting.
Genitourinary: Reports abnormal vaginal bleeding. Denies urinary issues.
Psychiatric: Reports depression

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: There is slight tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant. No rebounding or guarding.

Pelvic
- Examination: There are no external lesions on the labia. The vaginal vault is within normal limits. The cervix is pink without lesions. On bimanual exam, I appreciate a left adnexal mass. No masses on the right.

RESULTS

CT scan of the abdomen was reviewed and demonstrated a 3 cm left ovarian mass with associated localized lymph node involvement. There is no evidence of gross peritoneal or metastatic disease.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Ovarian cancer.
- Medical Reasoning: Looking at her abdominal CT results, it appears to be stage IIIA disease based on the lymph node involvement.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained to the patient that the typical approach to treating this stage of cancer is surgical intervention followed by adjunct chemotherapy. The procedure and subsequent chemotherapy plans were discussed in detail. Given that she is young and otherwise healthy, I reassured her that I believe her prognosis is favorable based on her current status, however, this is dependent on the final pathology report. All of her questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: I want to start by ordering several blood tests including a CA-125, hCG, AFP, and LDH. I also want her to undergo genetic counseling and testing to see if she has a genetic predisposition for developing ovarian cancer. I recommend we perform a hysterectomy and oophorectomy, as well as a lymph node dissection to remove any involved lymph nodes. Any concerning tissue will be biopsied and sent to pathology for staging. After she has recovered from surgery, she will start chemotherapy treatment with cisplatin and Taxol. We may also consider intraperitoneal chemotherapy.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.", [doctor] okay so we are recording okay so okay so i understand you've so you've got a past medical

to see if you have a genetic predisposition for developing ovarian cancer so this stage of ovarian cancer is treated by performing surgery followed by adjunct chemotherapy so this means we'll start

nodes as well as any other ones i see and i'll also send a sample of any tissue if there anything that looks suspicious at all and we'll be able to tell exactly what stage this is based on the

aci,D2N056,"[patient] alright thanks for coming in today i see on my chart here that you had a bunch of lower respiratory infections so first tell me how are you what's going on
[doctor] you know i'm doing better now but you know last week i was really sick and i just have had enough like i was coughing a lot a lot of mucus even had some shortness of breath and even a low-grade fever
[patient] wow that is a lot so what did you do for some of those symptoms
[doctor] you know i ended up drinking a lot of fluid and taking some robitussin and i actually got better over the weekend and now i'm feeling much better but what concerns me is that i i tend to get pneumonia a lot
[patient] okay so when you say a lot like how frequently does it occur i would say it seem honestly it seems like it's every month or every other month especially over the past six six months that i just keep getting sick and i usually will end up having to go to my primary care doctor or
[doctor] urgent care and i'll get prescribed some antibiotics and one time i actually ended up in the emergency room
[patient] wow and how long do your symptoms normally last for
[doctor] you know it could be as few as like a couple of days but sometimes it could go even up to a week
[patient] mm-hmm you mentioned that you are a farmer did you do you notice that your symptoms occur while doing certain things on the farm
[doctor] you know i was trying to think about that and i've been working on the farm for some time but the only thing i can think about is that i've been helping my brother out and i've been started like unloading a lot of hay which i do n't usually do and i wan na say that my symptoms actually start the days that i'm unloading hay
[patient] alright do you wear a mask when you're unloading hay
[doctor] no i do n't do that
[patient] okay
[doctor] none of us do
[patient] okay yeah so like that your brother does n't either
[doctor] no i'm the only one who seems to be getting sick
[patient] alright so i know you said you were trying to like help out your brother like what's going on with him
[doctor] you know we've just been getting really busy and so he has been working around doing other things so i've just been helping him just cover the extra load
[patient] mm-hmm okay alright do you have any other siblings
[doctor] yeah there is actually ten of us
[patient] wow okay that's that's a lot of siblings
[doctor] yeah i'm okay
[patient] maybe maybe we could we could always stick them in they could get some work done the holidays must be fun at your place
[doctor] yeah we do n't need to hire any i mean have anyone else this is our family
[patient] you're right keep it in the family okay so speaking of family do you have do you or anyone have a history of seasonal allergies
[doctor] no no i have never had any problems with allergies
[patient] okay and do you smoke
[doctor] i do n't smoke
[patient] do you live with anybody who does
[doctor] i do not
[patient] okay alright so okay so now i i wan na go ahead and do my physical exam i'm gon na call out some of my findings just to make sure that i'm documenting everything and if you have any questions about what it is that i'm saying please feel free to ask okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] so i reviewed your vitals and you appear to be breathing a little fast your respiratory rate is twenty but but your oxygen is you're satting kind of fine at ninety nine percent on room air so i'm not too worried about that on for on your heart exam i do you have a regular rate and regular rhythm i do not appreciate any murmurs rubs or gallops on your lung exam you know i do you do have some fine rales on your lung exam but no wheezes and on your musculoskeletal exam i do not appreciate any clubbing of your fingers so for your results i did review the results of your chest x-ray and i noticed some round glass opacities so let me tell you a little bit about like my assessment and plan for your first problem of recurrent lung infections your symptoms seem consistent with a condition we call hypersensitivity pneumonitis in your case another name is farmer's lung which you know is appropriate considering your job this could be caused by bacteria and or mold that is found in the hay when you inhale it it leads to an allergic reaction in your lungs this is why your symptoms occur every time you move hay for your current symptoms i'm gon na prescribe you a a course of an oral steroid this will help to decrease the inflammation that is occurring in your lungs i will also be ordering a cat scan of your lungs which will help confirm the diagnosis as as well a pulmonary function test to assess how severe your respiratory impairment is it would be best if you could eliminate your exposure to the hay or prevent further to prevent further damage to your lungs however if you are unable it's very important that you wear a respirator when moving hay around i know that that was a lot of information i think it boils down to pull in more of your siblings to help work around but do you have any questions
[doctor] yeah so is this gon na help so i do n't keep getting sick
[patient] so ideally what we are doing i think this is the best course of action to deal with the deeper problem right of these infections and to kind of like clear up the pneumonia everything seems to hint on so what we're gon na do is treat your current infection we're going to either prevent you from being around hay or make it so that it's safe for you to be with hay and then we're gon na see like what we need to do moving forward does that help
[doctor] okay it does
[patient] alright
[doctor] thank you
[patient] okay no problem
[doctor] alright","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Recurrent lung infections.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is a farmer. He denies smoking or living with anyone who smokes.

ALLERGIES

Patient denies history of seasonal allergies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports low-grade fever.
Respiratory: Reports shortness of breath and productive cough.

VITALS

Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute.
Pulse oxygenation: 99 percent on room air.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Some fine rales were noted.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops or rubs.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: No clubbing.

RESULTS

X-ray of the chest was reviewed today and shows some round glass opacities.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Recurrent lung infections.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's symptoms seem consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. He is a farmer and has been moving hay quite frequently recently.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The nature of the diagnosis was discussed with the patient. I explained that hypersensitivity pneumonitis could be caused by bacteria and/or mold that is found in the hay. We discussed that when inhaling this, it leads to an allergic reaction in the lungs, which would explain why symptoms occur every time he moves hay. He was advised that it would be best to eliminate his exposure to hay in order to prevent further damage to his lungs, however, if he is unable to do this then it would be recommended that he wear a respirator when working. Questions were invited and answered today.
- Medical Treatment: A course of oral steroids were prescribed today to help decrease his lung inflammation. CT of the lungs will also be ordered today to confirm the diagnosis. A pulmonary function test was also ordered to assess the severity of his respiratory impairment.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.", [doctor] you know i'm doing better now but you know last week i was really sick and i just have

that you are a farmer did you do you notice that your symptoms occur while doing certain things on the farm [doctor] you know i was trying to think about that and i've been working on the farm for some time but the only thing i can think about is that i've been helping my brother out and i've been started like unloading a lot of hay which i do n't usually do and i wan na say that my symptoms actually start the days that i'm unloading hay [patient] alright do you wear a mask when you're unloading hay [patient] okay [doctor] none of us do [patient] okay yeah so like that your brother does n't either [doctor] no i'm the only one who seems to be getting sick [patient] alright so i know you said you were trying to like help out your brother like what's going on with him [patient] mm-hmm okay alright do you have any other siblings [doctor] yeah there is actually ten of us [patient] wow okay that's that's a lot of siblings [patient] maybe maybe we could we could always stick them in they could get some work done the holidays must be fun at your place [doctor] yeah we do n't need to hire any i mean have anyone else this is our family [patient] you're right keep it in the family okay so speaking of family do you have do you or anyone have a history of seasonal allergies [doctor] no no i have never had any problems with allergies [patient] okay and do you smoke [doctor] i do n't smoke [patient] do you live with anybody who does [doctor] i do not [patient] okay alright so okay so now i i wan na go ahead and do my physical exam i'm gon na call out some of my findings just to make sure that i'm documenting everything and if you have any questions about what it is that i'm saying please feel free to ask okay [doctor] okay [patient] so i reviewed your vitals and you appear to be breathing a little fast your respiratory rate is twenty but but your oxygen is you're satting kind of fine at ninety nine percent on room air so i'm not too worried about that on for on your heart exam i do you have a regular rate and regular rhythm i do not appreciate any murmurs rubs or gallops on your lung exam you know i do you do have some fine rales on your lung exam but no wheezes and on your musculoskeletal exam i do not appreciate any clubbing of your fingers so for your results i did review the results of your chest x-ray and i noticed some round glass opacities so let me tell you a little bit about like my assessment and plan for your first problem of recurrent lung infections your symptoms seem consistent with a condition we call hypersensitivity pneumonitis in your case another name is farmer's lung which you know is appropriate considering your job this could be caused by bacteria and or mold that is found in the hay when you inhale it it leads to an allergic reaction in your lungs this is why your symptoms occur every time you move hay for your current symptoms i'm gon na prescribe you a a course of an oral steroid this will help to decrease the inflammation that is occurring in your lungs i will also be ordering a cat scan of your lungs which will help confirm the diagnosis as as well a pulmonary function test to assess how severe your respiratory impairment is it would be best if you could eliminate your exposure to the hay or prevent further to prevent further damage to your lungs however if you are unable it's very important that you wear a respirator when moving hay around i know that that was a lot of information i think it boils down to pull in more of your siblings to help work around but do you have any questions [patient] so ideally what we are doing i think this is the best course of action to deal with the deeper problem right of these infections and to kind of like clear up the pneumonia everything seems to hint on so what we're gon na do is treat your current infection we're going to either prevent you from being around hay or make it so that it's safe for you to be with hay and then we're gon na see like what we need to do moving forward does that help [doctor] okay it does [patient] alright [doctor] thank you [patient] okay no problem [doctor] alright, [patient] alright thanks for coming in

[patient] what happens in the in a real
[doctor] a hundred percent so how about this right now you're like i what i'm hearing is that you're experiencing bilateral knee pain like both of your knees hurt but i'm assuming that like your right knee hurts more is that correct

[patient] it's been slow

[patient] for as long as my walk is and i do n't sometimes i walk five minutes kinda depends on the wind
[doctor] okay alright
[patient] sometimes i walk there is
[doctor] okay alright have you done anything to help with the pain
[patient] well i wear a brace and i have used a lot of thc cream on it
[doctor] okay alright thc cream is an interesting choice but do you think that's been helpful
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright have you taken
[patient] reasons
[doctor] not a problem have you taken any medications
[patient] no just gummies
[doctor] okay like vitamins or more thc
[patient] kind of like thc gummies
[doctor] thc gummies
[patient] my grandma gave them to me
[doctor] thc gummies from grandma that's an excellent grandmother that you have okay have you noticed any swelling stiffness tenderness
[patient] yeah i i get a lot of swelling and it really is it's very stiff in the morning until i get walking
[doctor] okay alright and then have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past
[patient] well i had surgery on my right knee before
[doctor] okay so you've had surgery before alright do you remember what kind of surgery
[patient] i do n't know they told me they reconstructed the whole thing i was fourteen i was a really good gymnast back then really good
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i was doing a back summer salt and i felt a pop then and then since that time i've really had problems with my knee
[doctor] uh uh
[patient] but you know the athlete that i am i can still really ski very well so i just kept going
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i'm really tough my pain tolerance is very high
[doctor] okay okay okay how so do you have any other exercises that i might wan na know about outside of intense gym and ski events
[patient] no i think that's about it
[doctor] okay and how frequently do you normally ski
[patient] i ski probably three times a week
[doctor] okay and then are you on any medications at this time other than the thc
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright what
[patient] nothing no
[doctor] okay alright not a problem so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my examination i'm just gon na call it out for the sake of being able to document it appropriately and you or just just let me know if you want me to explain anything further so with your knee i know that you said it hurts on the right inside a lot right so when i press on the inside of your knee does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay and when i press on the outside of your left of your right knee sorry does that hurt
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright so when i move your your kneecap does that hurt
[patient] no it kinda makes a shooting pain down to my ankle though
[doctor] okay
[patient] but it does n't hurt my knee
[doctor] okay so does the pain radiate frequently
[patient] no
[doctor] okay
[patient] i've never really noticed it just messed with my kneecap
[doctor] okay alright on your skin exam i do appreciate some mild swelling and bruising that's really interesting since it's been two weeks with your knee are you able to bend it
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay and then when you walked in on your gait i think i think i did appreciate a slight limp are you i i i i think you are you are protecting one of your knees does that sound familiar
[patient] yeah i waddle pretty pretty good now
[doctor] okay alright and when you move your knee away from your body you're bending like your you're pulling it towards me does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay and then when you pull your knee back towards you does that hurt
[patient] no
[doctor] alright so pain on dorsiflexion but not on plantar flexion plantar flexion okay alright so what we are gon na do right now i think i'm gon na look at your x-rays but when i when i look at the results of your x-ray i do not appreciate any fracture what i am noticing is the development of a little bit of arthritis and that could explain like why you say that your joints hurt a bit more during like windy weather and what not so this is what we're gon na do for my assessment and plan right the first thing is i think you have a strain of your posterior cruciate ligament what that means is what that will mean for you though is that we are gon na continue to brace your right knee that's gon na hopefully take off some of the stress that you might be putting on it especially since you're limping i am going to recommend you for physical therapy i think it would be an i think it's a good idea to maybe start three times a week to get your strength back into your knee i would recommend not skiing or doing any gymnastics for now and i think that physical therapy will really help considering the injury that you had when you were fourteen i'm gon na prescribe you some medications i do n't necessarily recommend consuming gummies at the same time but the medications i'm gon na give you are gon na be meloxicam fifteen milligrams you're gon na take that once a day that will help with like the swelling and the bruising i'm also gon na prescribe you just like a higher strength nsaid so ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams a day you can take that twice a day as needed for your left knee i think you are i think you just kind of like strength a little bit but like not enough to necessarily require any kind of like medication or bracing i think you just take it easy on your body i know that you're like very active from what i hear and i i think that that's really exciting but i think you might need to listen to your body and give yourself a bit of a break you'll be able to do like several workouts when you go to when you go to physical therapy but you know let the yeah let your therapist be your guide about like what you should and should not be putting your body through does that make sense
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright do you have any questions right now
[patient] no thank you so much
[doctor] no problem","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Elizabeth Ross is a pleasant 91-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. The onset of her pain began 2 weeks ago, when she was downhill skiing. She states she ran into a tree and twisted her right knee. At the time of the injury, she also heard a pop in her left knee, however she denies left knee pain. The patient locates her pain to the medial aspect of her right knee. Currently, her pain level is 7 out of 10, however she notes this can reach an 11 out of 10 at times with prolonged ambulation. The patient states that her pain has been slowly increasing over the last few days. She experiences limping with ambulation. The patient states that her pain lasts for as long as she is ambulating. She denies radiating pain. She also reports constant swelling and stiffness in the morning. Her stiffness will resolve with ambulation. The patient has been wearing a brace and using THC cream, which has been helpful. She denies taking any medications for pain, however she has been utilizing THC gummies, which have been beneficial.

The patient has a history of a right knee reconstruction when she was 14 years old. She states that she was a good gymnast at that time. The patient adds that she has had problems with her right knee since that time. She denies any other exercises outside of intense gym and ski events. The patient states that she normally skis 3 times per week.

SURGICAL HISTORY

The patient reports a history of total right knee reconstruction at the age of 14.

MEDICATIONS

She denies needing medications.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain, swelling, and stiffness. Denies left knee pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right knee: Mild effusion. The patient ambulated with an antalgic gait. Pain with dorsiflexion, but not with plantarflexion.

RESULTS

4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures. There is development of mild arthritis.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right knee posterior cruciate ligament strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with continued bracing. We will initiate formal physical therapy 3 times per week to strengthen her right knee. Additionally, I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg and ibuprofen 800 mg twice daily as needed. She should discontinue the use of her THC gummies while taking these medications.

Regarding her left knee, I do not believe she will need any further medications to treat this. I have advised her to avoid skiing or gymnastics at this time.

[patient] that's the one that popped it the left knee just feels unstable but my right knee hurts [doctor] gotcha gotcha okay yeah i think hmmm alright so we're gon na we're gon na go ahead and look at this sort of but on a scale of one to ten how severe is your pain [doctor] okay that's pretty bad alright and does it has it been increasing or like rapidly or slowly over the last few days [patient] it's been slow [doctor] okay alright [patient] but sometimes it gets to an eleven [doctor] okay what would do you know if you are doing something that would cause it to be an eleven are you back on your ski's [patient] no i ca n't ski [doctor] okay [patient] usually when i walk my dog [doctor] okay does it hurt more when you walk for longer periods of time [patient] yes [doctor] okay how long does the pain last [patient] for as long as my walk is and i do n't sometimes i walk five minutes kinda depends on the wind [doctor] okay alright [doctor] okay alright have you done anything to help with the pain [patient] well i wear a brace and i have used a lot of thc cream on it [doctor] okay alright thc cream is an interesting choice but do you think that's been helpful [patient] yes [doctor] alright have you taken [patient] reasons [doctor] not a problem have you taken any medications [patient] no just gummies [doctor] okay like vitamins or more thc [doctor] thc gummies [patient] my grandma gave them to me [doctor] thc gummies from grandma that's an excellent grandmother that you have okay have you noticed any swelling stiffness tenderness [patient] yeah i i get a lot of swelling and it really is it's very stiff in the morning until i get walking [doctor] okay alright and then have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past [patient] well i had surgery on my right knee before [doctor] okay so you've had surgery before alright do you remember what kind of surgery [patient] i do n't know they told me they reconstructed the whole thing i was fourteen i was a really good gymnast back then really good [doctor] okay [patient] and i was doing a back summer salt and i felt a pop then and then since that time i've really had problems with my knee [doctor] uh uh [patient] but you know the athlete that i am i can still really ski very well so i just kept going [doctor] okay [patient] and i'm really tough my pain tolerance is very high [doctor] okay okay okay how so do you have any other exercises that i might wan na know about outside of intense gym and ski events [doctor] okay and how frequently do you normally ski [patient] i ski probably three times a week [doctor] okay and then are you on any medications at this time other than the thc [patient] no [doctor] okay alright what [doctor] okay alright not a problem so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my examination i'm just gon na call it out for the sake of being able to document it appropriately and you or just just let me know if you want me to explain anything further so with your knee i know that you said it hurts on the right inside a lot right so when i press on the inside of your knee does that hurt [patient] yes [patient] no [patient] no it kinda makes a shooting pain down to my ankle though [doctor] okay [patient] but it does n't hurt my knee [doctor] okay so does the pain radiate frequently [patient] no [doctor] okay [patient] i've never really noticed it just messed with my kneecap [doctor] okay alright on your skin exam i do appreciate some mild swelling and bruising that's really interesting since it's been two weeks with your knee are you able to bend it [patient] yes [doctor] okay and then when you walked in on your gait i think i think i did appreciate a slight limp are you i i i i think you are you are protecting one of your knees does that sound familiar [doctor] okay alright and when you move your knee away from your body you're bending like your you're pulling it towards me does that hurt [patient] yes [doctor] okay and then when you pull your knee back towards you does that hurt [patient] no [doctor] alright so pain on dorsiflexion but not on plantar flexion plantar flexion okay alright so what we are gon na do right now i think i'm gon na look at your x-rays but when i when i look at the results of your x-ray i do not appreciate any fracture what i am noticing is the development of a little bit of arthritis and that could explain like why you say that your joints hurt a bit more during like windy weather and what not so this is what we're gon na do for my assessment and plan right the first thing is i think you have a strain of your posterior cruciate ligament what that means is what that will mean for you though is that we are gon na continue to brace your right knee that's gon na hopefully take off some of the stress that you might be putting on it especially since you're limping i am going to recommend you for physical therapy i think it would be an i think it's a good idea to maybe start three times a week to get your strength back into your knee i would recommend not skiing or doing any gymnastics for now and i think that physical therapy will really help considering the injury that you had when you were fourteen i'm gon na prescribe you some medications i do n't necessarily recommend consuming gummies at the same time but the medications i'm gon na give you are gon na be meloxicam fifteen milligrams you're gon na take that once a day that will help with like the swelling and the bruising i'm also gon na prescribe you just like a higher strength nsaid so ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams a day you can take that twice a day as needed for your left knee i think you are i think you just kind of like strength a little bit but like not enough to necessarily require any kind of like medication or bracing i think you just take it easy on your body i know that you're like very active from what i hear and i i think that that's really exciting but i think you might need to listen to your body and give yourself a bit of a break you'll be able to do like several workouts when you go to when you go to physical therapy but you know let the yeah let your therapist be your guide about like what you should and should not be putting your body through does that make sense [patient] yes [doctor] alright do you have any questions right now [patient] no thank you so much,

Assessment

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  1. Strain of the posterior cruciate ligament. - Medical Reasoning: The patient reports a pain level of 7.5 on a scale of 1 to 10. The diagnosis is based on her x-rays which I have reviewed and I do not appreciate due to the development of arthritis. I am going to recommend her for formal physical therapy 3 times per week.  2. A strain of her right knee Lateral aspect was examined and the patient is compliant with the recommended medical treatment plan.","Subjective

CHIEF COMPLAINT  Right knee pain.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient reports that she was flying down a black diamond and she ran into a tree when she fell and twisted her knee. She had surgery on her right knee before, but had no prior knee surgery. Her pain level is An A hundred percent). She denies any injury or pain, however, she describes her pain as unstable and stiff in the morning until she gets walking. This is an interesting choice because it has been increasing or slowly over the last few days, and does it hurt on the inside or the outside; whereas, it makes a shooting pain down to her ankle, which is where she has never noticed it. Of note, the patient notes that he has used thc cream on his brace, ibuprofen 8,000 mg per day and Tylenol 6,200 mg a day;; B. He states that his primary injury was when he was fourteen, his left knee did not hurt. The pain is in both knees and he describes a strain of his posterior cruciate ligamentament that caused him to fall and twist his knee, thus giving him an eleven-page skin exam, complete with skin traces, Gynecology reports and skin exams,

Pituitary lesion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Bruce Ward is a 52-year-old male with a pituitary lesion. The patient is seen in consultation at the request of Dr. Henry Howard for possible surgical intervention.

The patient presented to his primary care provider, Dr. Howard, on 03/01/2021 complaining of worsening headaches over the past few months. He denied any trouble with headaches in the past. Further work up of headaches with MRI of the brain revealed the pituitary lesion.

Mr. Ward reports headaches started about 3 months ago, at which point they were around 3 out of 10 in severity. They have gradually worsened over time and now he rates them at about 6/10. The headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and feel like a dull ache behind the eyes. They tend to last a few hours at a time, and nothing makes them particularly worse or better. Tylenol failed to improve headaches.

The patient endorses that recently he has been bumping into door frames, but no obvious problems with his balance or vision. He denies any recent sickness or feeling sick and negative for fever, rash, paresthesia, weakness, neck stiffness, or syncope.

Patient alert, oriented to person, place, and time, affect appropriate and speech fluent. Cranial nerve examination grossly intact. No focal motor or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities.

Eyes
Visual acuity and eye movements are normal. Pupils are equal and reactive. Visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia. Color vision is normal.

RESULTS

Labs reviewed, 03/03/2021: CBC, U&Es, coagulation, and CRP are all normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, all other results were normal.

Independent review and interpretation of MRI brain, 03/04/2021: The MRI reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

• Pituitary adenoma
• Bitemporal hemianopia

Mr. Ward is a very pleasant 52-year-old male who has a benign appearing pituitary adenoma discovered on work up for worsening headaches. There is clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression, examination today revealed a bitemporal hemianopia. Radiographically this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma but that there was no way to be sure without a pathological diagnosis. Surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa is indicated given optic chiasmal compression.

PLAN

Pituitary adenoma.
We discussed the general indications for surgical intervention. The risks, benefits to trans-sphenoidal resection were explained to the patient. The risks of anesthesia including but not limited to the risks of heart attack, stroke, and death. The risks of surgery including infection, need for further surgery, wound issues (such as spinal fluid leak or infection) which may require prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure, seizure, stroke, permanent numbness, weakness, difficulty speaking, or death. The patient voiced understanding and wishes to proceed with trans-sphenoidal resection of the adenoma.

Bitemporal hemianopia.
We will have the patient scheduled this week to have visual field testing with ophthalmology. The preoperative visual field will serve as baseline for comparison of postoperative visual field testing to monitor for improvement in the bitemporal hemianopia. Additionally, we discussed that unfortunately no guarantees could be given that his vision would return.

INSTRUCTIONS

• Refer to ophthalmology for baseline visual field testing.
• Schedule trans-sphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma.

[doctor] all right . the patient is alert , oriented to time , place , and person . affect is appropriate and speech is fluent . cranial nerve examination is grossly intact . no focal , motor , or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities . visual acuity and eye movements are normal . pupils are equal and reactive . visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia . and color vision is normal . [doctor] all right , mr. ward . i'm going to review these pictures from the mri with you . um , now this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma , but there's no way to be sure without sending the removed adenoma to pathology to make the diagnosis , which we will do . um , here you can see it's a well defined mass . and it's pressing right here on what we call the optic chiasm . and today when i was having you look at my fingers , you could n't see them off to the sides , that's what we call bitemporal hemianopia . and explains why you have been bumping into door frames . [patient] yeah i never noticed that i could n't see out of the side until you did that test , and you closed one eye with both eyes . i really could n't tell . [doctor] no because you're having this vision loss from the mass compressing the optic chiasm , the only option we have is to do surgery . [patient] okay , i understand . do you think i'll regain my vision ? [doctor] well there's no guarantees , but it is a possibility . i'm gon na refer you to the eye doctor for a full exam and they'll do what's called visual field test . this will map our your peripheral vision or side vision prior to surgery . and we can monitor after surgery to see if your vision is improving . [patient] all right . [doctor] and let's discuss the surgery a little more . um , we would do what's called a transsphenoidal approach to do the surgery . this is minimally invasive and we go through the sphenoid sinus . there are some risks i have to inform you of . uh , risk of anesthesia including but not limited to the risk of heart attack , stroke , and death . risk of surgery include infection , need for further surgery , wound issues such as spinal fluid leak or infection , uh , which may require long , prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure . uh , seizure , stroke , permanent numbness , weakness , difficulty speaking , or even death . [patient] well i guess we have to do it regardless . [doctor] okay . so i will have you see our surgery scheduler , deborah , on the way out to get you set up . we will get this scheduled fairly quickly so i do n't want you to be alarmed . um , she'll also get you set up today or tomorrow to have the visual field test and you may not be able to see the eye doctor until after surgery . but we have the pre-surgery visual field test for comparison after surgery . [patient] okay . i look forward to these headaches going away . i never thought it could be something like this going on . [doctor] yeah . come this way , we'll get your things lined up . please call if you think of any questions . [patient] thanks , doctor . [doctor] diagnosis will be pituitary adenoma . mr . ward is a very pleasant 52-year-old male who has benign appearing pituitary adenoma , incidentally discovered during workup for worsening headaches . he is symptomatic with clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression , therefor surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa is indicated . end of note .","CHIEF COMPLAINT  Abnormal headaches.
