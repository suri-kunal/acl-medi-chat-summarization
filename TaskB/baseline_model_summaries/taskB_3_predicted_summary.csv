[doctor] hello , are you mr. allen ?
[patient] yes , i am .
[doctor] hi . my name is dr. edwards . nice to meet you .
[patient] nice to meet you .
[doctor] welcome to the gi specialty clinic .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] did you have any problems finding us ?
[patient] no , i've been here with my sister once before .
[doctor] good . so how can i help you today ? uh , the referral i have is for abdominal pain and diarrhea .
[patient] right . so i've had ... i've been having this pain right here in my stomach , like right around here .
[doctor] so in the area of your mid abdomen , just below the belly button ?
[patient] correct . i've had the pain on and off for about two years . i finally went to the er and a ... a few months ago and they did a ct scan .
[doctor] i saw that .
[patient] yeah . they said they did n't really see anything on the scan .
[doctor] yes , i agree . it looked normal .
[patient] the problem is i'm either constipated or have explosive diarrhea .
[doctor] is the pain there all the time ?
[patient] it's a nagging feeling and it just depends . sometimes it bothers me , sometimes it does n't .
[doctor] has this been the case over the past two years as well ?
[patient] more recently in the past couple months , at least with the constipation and diarrhea .
[doctor] and before that , how are your bowel movements ?
[patient] they were normal .
[doctor] uh , okay . so any blood in your stool ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] do you feel like you have more constipation or diarrhea ?
[patient] probably more constipation .
[doctor] okay , so when you're constipated , do you not have a bowel movement or is the stool hard ?
[patient] i usually do n't go , but when i do , it's hard .
[doctor] and how often do you have a bowel movement when you are constipated ?
[patient] about three to four times a week . it's like when i need to go to the bathroom , if i can massage it , it feels like it's moving some and i can eventually go .
[doctor] okay . and when you have a bowel movement , does the pain change ?
[patient] yeah , it gets a little better .
[doctor] and are you eating and drinking okay ? any nausea or vomiting , heartburn or indigestion ?
[patient] none of that .
[doctor] okay . so tell me about the diarrhea , how often do you get it ?
[patient] it kinda just depends on what i eat . i think i have a very sensitive stomach . if i eat pasta with a creamy sauce , i'm probably gon na have diarrhea .
[doctor] okay . and it does n't happen for multiple days in a row or is it just one time ?
[patient] it's usually just one time and then it's over .
[doctor] and how's your weight been ? any fluctuation ?
[patient] nice and pretty stable , although i could stand to lose about 25 pounds .
[doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi issues that you know of ?
[patient] not that i can think of . well , actually my sister does have problems with her stomach too . she has irritable bowel syndrome and that is kind of what i always thought i had even thought i've never been diagnosed with it .
[doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi cancer or liver disease ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] have you ever had any surgeries on your abdomen ?
[patient] i've never had any surgery .
[doctor] okay , so your gallbladder , appendix , all those are still intact ?
[patient] yup .
[doctor] and have you ever had a colonoscopy ?
[patient] no . i thought that happen when you turn 50 .
[doctor] well , that's for colon cancer screening , but there are other reasons to have a colonoscopy , like unexplained abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] well , come have a seat here and lay back so i can examine you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i'm gon na start by listening to your belly with my steth- stethoscope . and i hear bowel sounds in all four quadrants .
[patient] what does that mean ? is everything okay ?
[doctor] it just means that i can hear little noises in all areas of your belly , which means your bowels are active and working .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so now , i'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen . let me know if you have any pain .
[patient] it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side , near my belly button .
[doctor] okay . i do feel stool in your lower colon , which would coincide with constipation , but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ?
[patient] yes , i have a physical about four months ago and they ... i had blood drawn then .
[doctor] okay . and did your primary care physician say anything about the lab results ?
[patient] he said i had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes , but we would recheck them in about six months .
[doctor] and you remember what enzymes were elevated , alt , ast , alp ?
[patient] he said the alt and the ast were elevated .
[doctor] and do you take any medications , either prescription or over-the-counter ?
[patient] i take crestor and olmesartan daily and then tylenol for occasion- occasional pain .
[doctor] and how frequently do you take the tylenol ?
[patient] hardly ever . maybe once a month .
[doctor] and do you consume alcohol ?
[patient] uh , yes , but only a couple of beers after working in the yard on saturdays .
[doctor] okay . and no previous history of heavy alcohol or drug use ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] and have you had any recent issues with excessive bruising or bleeding ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] and how about any issues with your ankles or feet swelling ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice .
[patient] what would cause that ?
[doctor] issues with your liver . let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] lungs are clear , bilateral heart sounds are normal , no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted .
[patient] that's good .
[doctor] yes . the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly .
[patient] what's that ?
[doctor] increase stool burden means that there's a lot of stool sitting in your colon .
[patient] and that's the constipation , right ? but what about the other thing ?
[doctor] the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged .
[patient] but you said mine was slightly enlarged ?
[doctor] correct .
[patient] so what does that mean ?
[doctor] well , let's talk about what we found and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so as i said , the hepatomegaly means your liver is enlarged .
[patient] could that be why my stomach is hurting and i'm having issues with the constipation and diarrhea ?
[doctor] no , i think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat . and we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that .
[patient] so what about my liver ? why is it enlarged ?
[doctor] well , there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also enlarged liver . some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to liver , alcohol abuse , fatty liver disease , hepatitis , cirrhosis , and other liver diseases like wilson's disease .
[patient] so what do i need to do ?
[doctor] well , i think since it's been about four months since your blood work was done , we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs .
[patient] okay . and then what ?
[doctor] we will get those drawn today and then depending upon the results you may need an ultrasound of your liver . i think we need to talk about your medications too .
[patient] which medications ?
[doctor] crestor , how long have you been taking that ?
[patient] about 18 months .
[doctor] okay . well , crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity so it may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives .
[patient] should i talk to my primary care or can you change it ?
[doctor] i would recommend calling your primary care and discuss that with him since he follows you for your blood pressure and cholesterol .
[patient] okay . i'll call him this afternoon .
[doctor] great . i also think we should go ahead and get you scheduled for a liver ultrasound . if your blood work looks good , then we can always cancel that .
[patient] okay . when do you think i'll be able to get the ultrasound done ?
[doctor] hopefully , within the next two weeks . you will receive a call from the radiology scheduling this afternoon to get it set up .
[patient] okay . and then what happens ?
[doctor] when i get the results from the test , i will contact you . and depending upon what we find , we'll come up with our next steps .
[patient] and when should i see you again ?
[doctor] uh , let's schedule an appointment when you check out to return in four weeks . we'll discuss how you're doing with the fiber supplement and your constipation and review test results to determine if we need to do further testing on your liver .
[patient] okay . is there anything else i can do to help with these issues ?
[doctor] definitely refrain from drinking any alcohol , increase your water intake to at least 48 ounces a day in addition to taking the fiber supplement to help with your constipation . and be mindful of eating foods that you were sensitive to so you can avoid the bouts of diarrhea .
[patient] okay . and i'll talk to my primary care about my crestor .
[doctor] excellent . and do you have any other questions for me ?
[patient] i do n't think so .
[doctor] great . so remember when you check out the front desk , schedule follow-up appointment with me for four weeks and then go to the lab to get your blood work drawn .
[patient] okay . sounds good .
[doctor] and expect a call from radiology scheduling about setting up your ultrasound .
[patient] all right . thanks , dr. edwards .
[doctor] thank you , mr. allen .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Abdominal pain and diarrhea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Patrick Allen is a 42-year-old male who presents for a new patient visit for chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea.

Mr. Allen reports experiencing intermittent mid-abdominal pain for approximately 2 years. The pain is localized just inferior to the umbilicus and he describes it as a “nagging feeling” when it is present. The pain sometimes improves following a bowel movement. Unfortunately, Mr. Allen reports that the pain has been present more often in the past 2 months. In 01/2020, the patient presented to the emergency room due to the pain and underwent a CT scan.

In addition to the abdominal pain, Mr. Allen complains of constipation and episodic severe diarrhea for the past 2 months; however, he estimates that the constipation is more frequent than the diarrhea. When he is constipated, he has a bowel movement 3-4 times a week and the stools are hard. Regarding his diarrhea, he has noticed that it seems to be associated with certain foods. In particular, he notes that pasta with a creamy sauce is likely to prompt an episode of diarrhea. When this occurs, he usually has just 1 bowel movement of diarrhea and then it resolves. The patient states that, prior to 2 months ago, his bowel movements were normal. Mr. Allen notes that massaging his abdomen has sometimes been helpful in producing a bowel movement.

The patient’s last physical was 4 months ago, and he confirms that he did have bloodwork that day. Mr. Allen reports that his primary care provider notified him that his AST and ALT were mildly elevated and advised that they would need to recheck his liver enzymes in 6 months. The patient’s medication list includes Crestor and olmesartan daily and he estimates that he has been taking the Crestor for approximately 18 months. He also takes Tylenol as needed for pain, approximately once a month. The patient states that he drinks 2 beers once a week and denies a history of heavy alcohol or drug use. He also denies excessive bruising or bleeding and any lower extremity edema.

The patient denies blood in his stools, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, and indigestion. He confirms that he is eating and drinking normally, and his weight has been stable. He does acknowledge that he would like to lose 25 pounds, however. He has no family history of gastrointestinal cancer or liver disease; however, his sister has irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The patient has not had any prior abdominal surgeries and he has never had a colonoscopy.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
No murmurs, gallops, or rubs.

Abdomen
Normoactive bowel sounds in all 4 quadrants. There is mild left periumbilical tenderness to palpation, mild hepatomegaly, and increased stool burden in colon.

RESULTS

CT of Abdomen, 01/23/2020.
Impression: Normal CT of abdomen.

ASSESSMENT

• Constipation
• Mild hepatomegaly

PLAN

Patrick Allen is a 42-year-old male who presents for a new patient visit for chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. The most likely etiology of his abdominal pain is constipation given his history, exam with increased stool burden, and normal abdominal CT. Mild hepatomegaly was also noted on exam today and the patient reportedly had elevated liver enzymes on labs with his primary care provider 4 months ago. The patient is currently on Crestor which may be contributing to his elevated liver enzymes. We discussed findings, diagnosis, and next steps at length.

Constipation
• Start daily fiber supplement and increase water consumption to at least 48 ounces daily to help with bowel regularity.
• Avoid trigger foods that may cause episodes of diarrhea.

Mild Hepatomegaly
• Repeat liver enzyme labs today.
• Schedule a liver ultrasound pending lab results.
• Encouraged to cease alcohol consumption.
• Patient to contact his PCP to discuss alternative medications.

INSTRUCTIONS

Return to clinic in 4 weeks.

[doctor] good . so how can i help you today ? uh , the referral i have is for abdominal pain and diarrhea . [patient] right . so i've had ... i've been having this pain right here in my stomach , like right around here . [doctor] so in the area of your mid abdomen , just below the belly button ? [patient] correct . i've had the pain on and off for about two years . i finally went to the er and a ... a few months ago and they did a ct scan . [doctor] i saw that . [patient] yeah . they said they did n't really see anything on the scan . [doctor] yes , i agree . it looked normal . [patient] the problem is i'm either constipated or have explosive diarrhea . [doctor] is the pain there all the time ? [doctor] has this been the case over the past two years as well ? [patient] more recently in the past couple months , at least with the constipation and diarrhea . [doctor] and before that , how are your bowel movements ? [patient] they were normal . [patient] nope . [doctor] do you feel like you have more constipation or diarrhea ? [patient] probably more constipation . [doctor] okay , so when you're constipated , do you not have a bowel movement or is the stool hard ? [patient] i usually do n't go , but when i do , it's hard . [doctor] and how often do you have a bowel movement when you are constipated ? [doctor] and are you eating and drinking okay ? any nausea or vomiting , heartburn or indigestion ? [patient] none of that . [patient] it kinda just depends on what i eat . i think i have a very sensitive stomach . if i eat pasta with a creamy sauce , i'm probably gon na have diarrhea . [doctor] okay . and it does n't happen for multiple days in a row or is it just one time ? [doctor] and how's your weight been ? any fluctuation ? [patient] nice and pretty stable , although i could stand to lose about 25 pounds . [doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi issues that you know of ? [patient] not that i can think of . well , actually my sister does have problems with her stomach too . she has irritable bowel syndrome and that is kind of what i always thought i had even thought i've never been diagnosed with it . [patient] nope . [doctor] have you ever had any surgeries on your abdomen ? [patient] i've never had any surgery . [doctor] okay , so your gallbladder , appendix , all those are still intact ? [patient] yup . [doctor] and have you ever had a colonoscopy ? [doctor] well , that's for colon cancer screening , but there are other reasons to have a colonoscopy , like unexplained abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits . [patient] okay . [doctor] well , come have a seat here and lay back so i can examine you . [patient] okay . [doctor] i'm gon na start by listening to your belly with my steth- stethoscope . and i hear bowel sounds in all four quadrants . [doctor] it just means that i can hear little noises in all areas of your belly , which means your bowels are active and working . [patient] okay , good . [doctor] so now , i'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen . let me know if you have any pain . [patient] it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side , near my belly button . [doctor] okay . i do feel stool in your lower colon , which would coincide with constipation , but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ? [patient] yes , i have a physical about four months ago and they ... i had blood drawn then . [patient] he said i had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes , but we would recheck them in about six months . [doctor] and you remember what enzymes were elevated , alt , ast , alp ? [patient] he said the alt and the ast were elevated . [doctor] and do you take any medications , either prescription or over-the-counter ? [patient] i take crestor and olmesartan daily and then tylenol for occasion- occasional pain . [doctor] and how frequently do you take the tylenol ? [patient] hardly ever . maybe once a month . [doctor] and do you consume alcohol ? [patient] uh , yes , but only a couple of beers after working in the yard on saturdays . [doctor] okay . and no previous history of heavy alcohol or drug use ? [patient] nope . [doctor] and have you had any recent issues with excessive bruising or bleeding ? [patient] nope . [patient] no . [doctor] okay . i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice . [patient] what would cause that ? [doctor] issues with your liver . let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs . [patient] okay . [doctor] lungs are clear , bilateral heart sounds are normal , no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted . [patient] that's good . [doctor] yes . the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly . [patient] what's that ? [doctor] increase stool burden means that there's a lot of stool sitting in your colon . [patient] and that's the constipation , right ? but what about the other thing ? [doctor] the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged . [patient] but you said mine was slightly enlarged ? [doctor] correct . [patient] so what does that mean ? [doctor] well , let's talk about what we found and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement . [patient] okay . [doctor] so as i said , the hepatomegaly means your liver is enlarged . [patient] could that be why my stomach is hurting and i'm having issues with the constipation and diarrhea ? [doctor] no , i think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat . and we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that . [patient] so what about my liver ? why is it enlarged ? [doctor] well , there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also enlarged liver . some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to liver , alcohol abuse , fatty liver disease , hepatitis , cirrhosis , and other liver diseases like wilson's disease . [patient] so what do i need to do ? [doctor] well , i think since it's been about four months since your blood work was done , we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs . [patient] okay . and then what ? [doctor] we will get those drawn today and then depending upon the results you may need an ultrasound of your liver . i think we need to talk about your medications too . [patient] which medications ? [doctor] crestor , how long have you been taking that ? [patient] about 18 months . [doctor] okay . well , crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity so it may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives . [patient] should i talk to my primary care or can you change it ? [doctor] i would recommend calling your primary care and discuss that with him since he follows you for your blood pressure and cholesterol . [patient] okay . i'll call him this afternoon . [doctor] great . i also think we should go ahead and get you scheduled for a liver ultrasound . if your blood work looks good , then we can always cancel that . [doctor] hopefully , within the next two weeks . you will receive a call from the radiology scheduling this afternoon to get it set up . [patient] okay . and then what happens ? [doctor] when i get the results from the test , i will contact you . and depending upon what we find , we'll come up with our next steps . [patient] and when should i see you again ? [doctor] uh , let's schedule an appointment when you check out to return in four weeks . we'll discuss how you're doing with the fiber supplement and your constipation and review test results to determine if we need to do further testing on your liver . [doctor] definitely refrain from drinking any alcohol , increase your water intake to at least 48 ounces a day in addition to taking the fiber supplement to help with your constipation . and be mindful of eating foods that you were sensitive to so you can avoid the bouts of diarrhea . [patient] okay . and i'll talk to my primary care about my crestor . [doctor] excellent . and do you have any other questions for me ? [patient] i do n't think so .

There is no family history of weight gain or weight loss, anxiety, depression, or other issues with his body; however, he has been taking crestor daily for 18 months and takes Tylenol intermittently for occasional pain, along with eating foods that were sensitive to his diet. When he is constipated, his diarrhea is more frequent and more difficult to have. This has also been the case over the past 2 years as well. Finally, the patient states that he consumes alcohol only a couple of beers on saturdays and only drinks water only after work, limiting his consumption to 2-3 beers the other days of the week. Endorses occasional heavy drinking and occasional imbibing of wine or beer.

Right ankle pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Carolyn Jones is a pleasant 38-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of right ankle pain.

The patient sustained an injury to her right ankle when she slipped and fell on ice while taking her garbage out yesterday. This was her first right ankle injury. She believes she heard a pop at the time, but denies any associated numbness or tingling. Initially, she was unable to bear weight on the ankle and required help getting inside; however, she is now able to slightly bear weight but ambulates with an antalgic gait. Ice, elevation, and ibuprofen have been helpful at reducing her pain. She rates her current pain as 4/10, her pain without medication as 6/10, and her pain with medication as 1/10.

Of note, the patient participates in an intramural soccer league but has not been able to play since this injury.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has had several ankle injuries in the past. This is her first right ankle injury.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has a history of playing sports. She played soccer in college and is now in an intramural soccer league.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right ankle pain.
Neurological: Denies right ankle numbness or tingling.

VITALS

Normal

PHYSICAL EXAM

GAIT: antalgic gait
CV: Brisk capillary refill to less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.
NEURO: Sensation in the right ankle is intact to light touch distally.
MSK: Examination of the right ankle: Ecchymosis over the lateral malleolus associated with trace edema in that area. Tenderness to palpation over the anterolateral soft tissue. No laxity on anterior drawer testing or inversion stress testing. No bony tenderness on palpation of the foot or ankle area. Findings are consistent bilaterally.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the right ankle were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture.

ASSESSMENT

Lateral ligament complex sprain, Right ankle.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, her symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex, more specifically the anterior talofibular ligament. We had a lengthy discussion regarding the nature of this injury and the course of treatment. I advised her to keep her leg elevated when she is seated and continue to ice her ankle. She should also continue taking ibuprofen as-needed for pain and inflammation management. She will be placed in an Aircast to help stabilize her ankle, and I am going to order crutches so she can remain non-weight-bearing for the next couple of days. At that point, she can start bearing weight on the ankle as tolerated.

as we go through that now on musculoskeletal exam you have a normal gait i watched you you know kinda walk in here this morning your strength i just wan na check it when i go ahead and i want you to move your leg okay your muscle strength is is good you do have a three out of five for abduction of your legs bilaterally and that's you know kinda bringing your legs in the remainder of your muscle strength for your lower extremities is a five out of five now let me focus specifically on your knee examination i do n't see any redness or ecchymosis or warmth of the skin and those are big words you know i do n't see any bruising or or that redness there is no effusion that's just like a fluid underneath the knee i do n't appreciate that any at all you do seem to have some tenderness when i palpate and you do have a positive patellar grind test when you stood up i could feel that as we went through there you did say you had that knee pain with squatting but your lachman your anterior and posterior drawer and mcmurray test are all negative bilaterally neurologically and your your your lower extremities your patella and your achilles reflex are symmetrical and that's good so i did review the x-rays of both your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis so based on what you told me and reviewing the mri that you had done before you came in your symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome and this is a really common condition that we see that causes knee knee pain especially in really active young people that's probably why i do n't get it when i'm riding my bike forever and ever now this condition has to do with the way your kneecap moves across along the groove of your thigh bone your femur so for pain i want you to continue to take the

This is an extremely common condition that we see in really active young people and it is exacerbated by activities that wear the knees down, such as jumping on the bike or running, which is not ideal for her. However, she notes she enjoys doing some of the running and running that is her favorite activity and she rates her pain at least half-a-mile per day.Â  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS  Musculoskeletal: Reports right knees pain and swelling in the achilles’ flank, lachman , and anterior and posterior drawer and mcmurray test are all negative bilaterally and that gives the patient relief.  VITALS  Tylenol  

Exam

PHYSICAL EXAM  CV: Normal gait. Patellar grind test is at a regular and slower rate. No murmurs. Achilles reflex symmetrical.  Musculoskeletal - Examination of Abdomen: No effusion. - A positive drawer drawer and mcmurray test are all negative bilaterally neurologically. | A normal upper drawer/ posterior drawer. McM McMurry test, negative. • Auscultation of the right anterior kneecap, anterior drawer, and posterior posterior, McMuranry and MDm. Heart rate is normal. 0.5/5 for abduction of your bilateral legs, 5 out of 5 for the Achelim, 1/2/3/6 for joint jointation. Respiratory - Anacostatics: There is no tenderness when palpating. You do seem to have a normal achillean and lateral drawer grinding test. Vitals are normal, but there are no effusions of ecchymosis or warmth. Again, the heart is a little slower than the other 95.6. Integumentary - Palpation: Right lower extremities, patellars, right midline, left lateral ones, less than 3/4

Results

RESULTS  X-rays of the knees were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no fractures or osteoarthritis.  

Assessment

ASSESSMENT  1. Knee pain.  PLAN  I explained to the patient that her symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome. Based on what I have seen and reviewing the Mri that she had done before she came into the clinic, I believe her strength is comparable to that of her primary care physician who wanted to see her today. She has tried a number of treatment options, including telehealth visits all day long, and she has been compliant with the recommended ibuprofen and/or tylenol use. I advised her that continuing to take it a little bit easy for now but we are gon na get her back in the bike trail some day. This will help increase her lower extremity strength, mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you might have  INSTRUCTIONS  The patient will follow up with me in 2 1/2 hours to review her x-rays and MRI results."

aci,D2N049,"[doctor] hey linda good to see you today so looking here in my notes looks like you you think you have a kidney stone think you've had them before and and you i guess you're having some pain and while we are here i see you i see you have a you have past medical history of hypertension diabetes and we will check up on those as well so with your kidney stone can you tell me what happened what's going on
[patient] and i've been in a lot of pain it started about i would say probably about three days ago
[doctor] okay
[patient] started having pain on my left back
[doctor] okay
[patient] and since then i continued to have pain it is traveling a little lower it's gotten little low but i definitely have not passed it yet and i'm just in so much pain
[doctor] okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go
[patient] it's constant
[doctor] okay
[patient] all the time i ca n't get comfortable
[doctor] alright are you able to urinate
[patient] i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood
[doctor] okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes
[patient] i've had it for probably this might be my third time
[doctor] third time alright
[patient] yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time
[doctor] okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever
[patient] no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous
[doctor] okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain
[patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working
[doctor] okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved
[patient] yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah
[doctor] right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day
[patient] yeah
[doctor] so we are getting close there
[patient] okay
[doctor] yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff
[patient] i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff
[doctor] so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running
[patient] like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty
[doctor] okay
[patient] and then the bottom number has been between seventy and eighty okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the
[doctor] the one eighties which was really high
[patient] right
[doctor] so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that
[patient] trying my best but doc i really like my french fries
[doctor] yeah
[patient] like
[doctor] we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help
[patient] yeah some help could be helpful okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright
[doctor] so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday
[patient] i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds
[doctor] okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday
[patient] i do
[doctor] okay
[patient] i do take it
[doctor] that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that kidney stones you're having so i just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain
[patient] no chest pain
[doctor] no chest pain are you having any belly pain
[patient] the back pain is starting to kind of go down into my groin but i would n't say any back pain i mean abdominal pain
[doctor] no abdominal pain alright so let me check here i'm gon na listen to your heart real quick and so on your heart exam i do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already so not really worried about that currently listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles or wheezes so let me press here on your abdomen does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay i'm gon na press here on your back is that painful
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright so on your examination of your abdomen there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there is n't any rebound or guarding though and only there is also cva tinnitus on the right on your on your flank as well and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney that's what that that's that tenderness around your cva is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know right now because of your history of of having kidney stones you you do have a kidney stone so what we're gon na do is first off i'm gon na get you some pain medication kinda you're in a ton of pain right now i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having i do wan na make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kinda clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help i also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then i'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually i'm gon na have you you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days i want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension i'm gon na keep you on that two . five norvasc your your blood pressures look good so i'm not gon na make any changes there and then for your diabetes we'll keep you on the five hundred of metformin and i also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietitian and they will be able to help you with your your diet i know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it you know hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal so how does that all sound

[doctor] right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day [patient] yeah [doctor] so we are getting close there [patient] okay [patient] i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff [doctor] so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running [patient] like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty [doctor] okay [patient] and then the bottom number has been between seventy and eighty okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the [doctor] the one eighties which was really high [patient] right [doctor] so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that [patient] trying my best but doc i really like my french fries [doctor] yeah [patient] like [doctor] we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help [patient] yeah some help could be helpful okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright [patient] i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds [patient] i do [doctor] okay [patient] i do take it [doctor] that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that kidney stones you're having so i just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain [patient] no chest pain [patient] the back pain is starting to kind of go down into my groin but i would n't say any back pain i mean abdominal pain [doctor] no abdominal pain alright so let me check here i'm gon na listen to your heart real quick and so on your heart exam i do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already so not really worried about that currently listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles or wheezes so let me press here on your abdomen does that hurt [patient] yes [patient] yes [doctor] alright so on your examination of your abdomen there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there is n't any rebound or guarding though and only there is also cva tinnitus on the right on your on your flank as well and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney that's what that that's that tenderness around your cva is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know right now because of your history of of having kidney stones you you do have a kidney stone so what we're gon na do is first off i'm gon na get you some pain medication kinda you're in a ton of pain right now i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having i do wan na make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kinda clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help i also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then i'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually i'm gon na have you you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days i want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension i'm gon na keep you on that two . five norvasc your your blood pressures look good so i'm not gon na make any changes there and then for your diabetes we'll keep you on the five hundred of metformin and i also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietitian and they will be able to help you with your your diet i know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it you know hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal so how does that all sound [doctor] okay no problem, [doctor] hey linda good to see you today so looking here in my notes looks like you you think you have a kidney stone think you've had them before and and you i guess you're having some pain and while we are here i see you i see you have a you have past medical history of hypertension diabetes and we will check up on those as well so with your kidney stone can you tell me what happened what's going on [patient] and i've been in a lot of pain it started about i would say probably about three days ago [doctor] okay [patient] started having pain on my left back [doctor] okay [patient] and since then i continued to have pain it is traveling a little lower it's gotten little low but i definitely have not passed it yet and i'm just in so much pain [doctor] okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go [patient] it's constant [doctor] okay [patient] all the time i ca n't get comfortable [doctor] alright are you able to urinate [patient] i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood [doctor] okay

time [doctor] third time alright [patient] yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time [doctor] okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever [patient] no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous [doctor] okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications

Right foot ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jeremy Roberts is a 79-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of a right foot ulcer. He reports an ulcer on his right foot has been present for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. He first noticed the ulcer after working outside. There is no associated pain, however, he feels the ulcer may have worsened from when he first noticed it. He denies experiencing any fevers or chills. He does however experience tension headaches quite frequently. He denies any pain in his calves when he walks. At this time the patient does not have a podiatrist for yearly foot exams.

He is a diabetic and takes insulin. His blood sugar has been running higher than normal and his last hemoglobin A1c was higher than 9. Occasionally he will also experience numbness and tingling in his feet, especially with colder weather.

In terms of his heart disease, the patient sustained a heart attack in 2018 and underwent stent placement at the right coronary artery. He is currently taking aspirin 81 mg daily. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.

There is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound.

ASSESSMENT

1. Non-healing ulcer, right foot
2. Diabetes
3. Coronary artery disease

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is fairly sizable and will require wound care. I advised him that the ulcer does not appear to be healing and that further studies will be needed to assess if he has adequate blood supply to heal his foot wound. He was advised that due to his diabetes it is possible surgical intervention such as stent placement or bypass surgery may be required to improve his blood supply. I also advised him that I believe we will be able to heal his wound. At this time, I have recommended continued wound care and for him to also continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily. We will order an arterial ultrasound of the lower extremities. He will also be referred to podiatry for a consult.

Regarding his diabetes, this appears to be unstable as the patient reports his last hemoglobin a1c was greater than 9 and is now experiencing a non-healing right foot ulcer. We discussed the importance of blood sugar control as this will impact his wound healing. At this time, I have recommended that he follow-up with his primary care physician for further care.

The patient's coronary artery disease is currently stable. It is recommended that he continue to take his statin as prescribed. I will contact his cardiologist for medical clearance should surgical intervention be required for his non-healing right foot ulcer.", [doctor] hi jeremy how are you [patient] i'm really good thank you how are you [doctor] i'm okay the the medical assistant told me that you had this ulcer on your foot that's been there for a couple of weeks [patient] yes [doctor] going away [patient] yeah it's

[doctor] okay okay yeah that would be great to see that because i wan na see what's going on so thank you for that tell me is there any family history of seizures or like tourette's syndrome
[patient] well no history of seizures but i i i never heard of that tourette thing

Right eye twitch.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient plays soccer every Saturday, however she has noted that there is a girl that tries to kick her and pulls her hair.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient's father reports that they do not have a family history of seizures or Tourette's syndrome.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies fever, chills, or changes in appetite.
Eyes: Reports right eye twitch. Denies right eye pain.
Respiratory: Denies cough.
Neurological: Denies headaches or sleep disturbances.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
- Orientation: Alert and oriented x3. Speech is clear and fluent. Gait is steady. Heel toe walking is normal. Cranial nerves grossly intact without focal neurologic findings. No pronator drift. Sensation is intact. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the biceps, triceps, knees, and ankles.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Transient tics.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's father provided a video today as she did not have a twitch in office. It appears the patient is experiencing a tic.
- Patient Education and Counseling: Nature of the diagnosis was discussed today with the patient and her father. I advised eye tics are very common in children and as many as 1 in 5 children have a tick during their school years. We discussed tics can also include things like shoulder shrugging, facial grimacing, sniffling, excessive throat clearing, and uncontrolled vocalization. I explained that essentially they are brief, sudden and involuntary motor movements and that we do not have a full understanding of the cause. We also discussed that they typically occur around 5 to 10 years of age and mostly resolve on their own within a year. Dad was advised that treatment is not recommended as they do not appear to be bothering Karen and she continues to do well in school and activities. Additionally, we discussed avoiding drawing attention to the tic as it may cause Karen to feel self-conscious and increase the severity of the tic.
- Medical Treatment: None at this time.

Patient Agreements: The patient's parent understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

evaluation.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Karen Nelson is a 3-year-old female with no significant past medical history who comes in for evaluation of a new right-angle twitch. She is accompanied by her father, who states that his daughter has been having a tick in her eye for a couple of weeks. The twitch occurs when the whole side of her face moves when it occurs it seems like it several seconds and then it finally stops and she just seems to be blinking frequently. Her father made a video so he can see what's going on just in case it doesn't do it during the visit. He reports that she reports some relief after it happens.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Coronary artery disease.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's exam is consistent with coronary artery disease.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that he should continue to watch his diet and salt intake. We also discussed that the cardiac rehab should help with his confidence with exercising regularly and for his education.
- Medical Treatment: Continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily Continue taking Brilinta 90 mg twice a day. Continue taking Lipitor 80 mg daily. Continue taking Toprol 50 mg daily. I will refer him to cardiac rehab.

2. Newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's physical exam is consistent with this diagnosis.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that his pumping function should improve in time. We also discussed that since he is compliant with his medications and presented to the cardiac cath lab quickly, he should recover. I advised the patient that he does not need to start a diuretic at this time.
- Medical Treatment: Continue taking lisinopril 20 mg a day. Prescription for Aldactone 12.5 mg daily provided. Order for labs provided. Repeat echocardiogram ordered to be completed in 2 months.

aci,D2N059,"[doctor] okay
[patient] good morning
[doctor] good morning thanks doctor doctor cooper i'm i'm you know i'm a little i'm sad to be in here but you know thanks for taking me in i appreciate it
[patient] sure absolutely what can i help you with today
[doctor] so you know i've been dealing with my asthma and like i tried to join sports but it's really kind of it's getting hard you know and i i i just wonder if there's something that can be done because i really do like playing water polo
[patient] but i'm having difficulty breathing sometimes i've had to like you know stop matches and sit on the side just to kind of like catch my breath and use my inhaler so i was wondering if there was something we could do about it
[doctor] and then like i'm kind of a little bit worried i think my mood is getting a little a little worrisome and i i wanted to explore like what my options were
[patient] okay let's talk about the asthma first so what inhaler are you using now
[doctor] i have an albuterol inhaler
[patient] okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night
[doctor] so i do n't really like wake up at night a lot typically like it's sports like you know if i'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything i do notice that if any if i'm around smoke i do start coughing a little bit but most of the time it's sports
[patient] okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens
[doctor] i start to yeah no so i start to feel like there is like some phlegm building up in my in my throat and i start coughing like my chest gets tight i start wheezing and i just have to sit down or else i'm gon na get like lightheaded too
[patient] okay and then when you use your inhaler
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] does it does it alleviate the problem
[doctor] so yeah it helps with that like phlegm feeling you know but i still i still have to sit down you know and like breathe and then the thing that i hate about that inhaler is i start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening
[patient] yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler
[doctor] okay
[patient] so you use you're using two puffs of the inhaler
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] for the symptoms
[doctor] yes
[patient] and then you sit down and does it does it get better within about fifteen minutes or so
[doctor] yeah yeah it does but you know i had to like step out of the the pool to make that happen i'm hoping that there is something else we can do okay have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma an inhaler or singulair or anything like that no i i just use my inhaler whenever i have an attack
[patient] okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening
[doctor] pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic workout
[patient] okay and outside of physical activity you're not having any problems
[doctor] yeah there's that part where like if i'm around somebody who has been smoking a lot or is currently smoking but i usually just step away i do n't even like to be around them you know that makes sense
[patient] alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having
[doctor] yeah so one of the reasons i got into like trying to get into sports is like i feel like you know you you feel a lot more energized and a lot you know happier but like lately i've just been kinda stressed out you know like i have i have like sats that i need to study for i've got like all these ap classes you know there's just it i feel like there's a lot of pressure and you know like i get it but there are times where i'm just like really down and i i do n't really know what else i can do
[patient] okay that makes sense any any difficulty with focusing or you're having difficulty retaining information or is it more feeling sad not having motivation
[doctor] so i think it's like a lot of sadness a lot of like you know i do n't really i kinda feel like you know i do n't really like want to do anything you know my friends will go out and i'll just be like i'd rather be at home i am really tired a lot too
[patient] okay alright well let me let me go ahead and check you out
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then we can talk a little bit more
[doctor] okay
[patient] i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and everything sounds good
[doctor] let me take a look at your eyes
[patient] mm-hmm and in your ears everything looks okay have you had any problems with allergies you have seasonal allergies or anything like that
[doctor] yeah i think so yeah
[patient] i do see just a little bit of fluid in the ears
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and i'm gon na look in your mouth too
[doctor] okay
[patient] and throat looks fine no tonsils
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] lem me go ahead and have you lay back on the table and i'll take a listen to your stomach
[doctor] okay
[patient] everything sounds okay i'm gon na feel around just to make sure everything feels normal
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] everything feels fine and i'm gon na check reflexes and they're all normal
[doctor] awesome
[patient] it's really hard to do with actual patient so in terms of the asthma i think we could try a daily medication since it looks like you might be having a little bit of allergies maybe we can try some singulair
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and start with that once you are on that daily and you can continue to use the albuterol inhaler those side effects unfortunately you're right it's it's just one of the expected side effects with an albuterol inhaler i would recommend just what you're doing just sit down for a little bit after you take it
[doctor] and we will get you started on the singulair probably within about a month you should see a difference so i will have you come back in about six weeks and follow up and see how you're doing with that
[patient] in terms of the mood is this new for you
[doctor] yeah i think so like when i started this year
[patient] and it sounds like related to school expectations and the stress with saps and all of that
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay let's consider having you start seeing a therapist i think that would be a good place to start
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and we will do some screening questionnaires and and then follow up in a couple weeks on that too
[doctor] okay alright sounds like a plan okay
[patient] thank you","CHIEF COMPLAINT

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Asthma.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has experienced an increased need to use her albuterol inhaler. She is not currently utilizing a daily medication. At this time, we will try a daily medication since it looks like she might be having some allergies.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the side effects of albuterol to the patient. We also discussed Singulair and that she should start to see a difference in her breathing within approximately 1 month.
- Medical Treatment: We will start her on a daily asthma medication. She can continue to use the albuterol inhaler. We will start her on Singulair in about a month.

2. Mood.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient reports being under a lot of stress with school. I believe this may be attributing to her mood.
- Medical Treatment: I would like for the patient to be seen by a therapist. She will also complete our screening questionnaire.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

inhaler whenever i have an attack [patient] okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening [doctor] pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic workout [patient] okay and outside of physical activity you're not having any problems [doctor] yeah there's that part where like if i'm around somebody who has been smoking a lot or is currently smoking but i usually just step away i do n't even like to be around them you know that makes sense [patient] alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having [patient] okay alright well let me let me go ahead and check you out [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] and then we can talk a little bit more [doctor] okay [patient] i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] and everything sounds good [doctor] let me take a look at your eyes [doctor] yeah i think so yeah [patient] i do see just a little bit of fluid in the ears [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] and i'm gon na look in your mouth too [doctor] okay [patient] and throat looks fine no tonsils [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] lem me go ahead and have you lay back on the table and i'll take a listen to your stomach [doctor] okay [patient] everything sounds okay i'm gon na feel around just to make sure everything feels normal [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] everything feels fine and i'm gon na check reflexes and they're all normal [doctor] awesome [patient] it's really hard to do with actual patient so in terms of the asthma i think we could try a daily medication since it looks like you might be having a little bit of allergies maybe we can try some singulair [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] and start with that once you are on that daily and you can continue to use the albuterol inhaler those side effects unfortunately you're right it's it's just one of the expected side effects with an albuterol inhaler i would recommend just what you're doing just sit down for a little bit after you take it [doctor] and we will get you started on the singulair probably within about a month you should see a difference so i will have you come back in about six weeks and follow up and see how you're doing with that [patient] in terms of the mood is this new for you [doctor] yeah i think so like when i started this year [patient] and it sounds like related to school expectations and the stress with saps and all of that [doctor] yeah [patient] okay let's consider having you start seeing a therapist i think that would be a good place to start [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] and we will do some screening questionnaires and and then follow up in a couple weeks on that too [doctor] okay alright sounds like a plan okay [patient] thank you, [doctor] okay [patient] good morning [patient] sure absolutely what can i help you with today [patient] but i'm having difficulty breathing sometimes i've had to like you know stop matches and sit on the side just to kind of like catch my breath and use my inhaler so i was wondering if there was something we could do about it [doctor] and then like i'm kind of a little bit worried i think my mood is getting a little a little worrisome and i i wanted to explore like what my options were [patient] okay let's talk about the asthma first so what inhaler are you using now [doctor] i have an albuterol inhaler [patient] okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night [doctor] so i do n't really like wake up at night a lot typically like it's sports like you know if i'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything i do notice that if any if i'm around smoke i do start coughing a little bit but most of the time it's sports [patient] okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens [doctor] i start to yeah no so i start to feel like there is like some phlegm building up in my in my throat and i start coughing like my chest gets tight i start wheezing and i just have to sit down or else i'm gon na get like lightheaded too [patient] okay and then when you use your inhaler [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] does it does it alleviate the problem [doctor] so yeah it helps with that like phlegm feeling you know but i still i still have to sit down you know and like breathe and then the thing that i hate about that inhaler is i start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening [patient] yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler [doctor] okay [patient] so you use you're using two puffs of the inhaler [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] for the symptoms [doctor] yes [patient] and then you sit down and does it does it get better within about fifteen minutes or so [doctor] yeah yeah it does but you know i had to like step out of the the pool to make that happen i'm hoping that there is something else we can do okay have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma an inhaler or singulair or anything like that no i i just use my inhaler whenever i have an attack [patient] okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening [doctor] pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic workout [patient] alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having [doctor] yeah so one of the reasons i got into like trying to get into sports is like i feel like you

[doctor] for your blood sugar check are you checking that or not really
[patient] i i i did it a couple of weeks ago
[doctor] okay
[patient] and it was about it i i think about two thirty it was okay
[doctor] okay so your hemoglobin a1c last time was seven . five and we had talked about you know trying to improve your diet we had talked about you know we wan na avoid going to insulin but it sounds like it's been a challenge to kinda control the diet and also your blood sugars have been running a little bit high
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay alright
[patient] yeah it's it's been a challenge
[doctor] alright and any nausea vomiting or diarrhea or anything like that are you peeing a whole lot or anything like that no
[patient] yeah i'm feeling like crazy
[doctor] okay alright
[patient] ca n't figure out why because i'm not drinking very much
[doctor] alright and how is your back then has that been okay i know you're sitting you said you're sitting on the couch a lot watching tv but
[patient] yeah
[doctor] besides that anything else
[patient] yeah you know it it just it just really hurts so you know and so that's why i sit on the couch so much
[doctor] okay alright no weakness or numbness in your legs right now
[patient] no
[doctor] okay
[patient] no
[doctor] so let me examine you now gloria i'm gon na go ahead and do an exam and let's pretend i did my exam i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings just so i can record this and put it into my my into my chart so neck exam you do have a little bit of swelling in your neck little bit of jvd no bruits your lung exam you have some crackles in both bases and some rales that i can hear and there are a little bit of intermittent wheezing as well on your heart exam you have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you've had that in the past otherwise regular rate and rhythm it does n't feel a regular your belly exam your belly's slightly distended there's no tenderness or guarding or anything like that so that does n't that looks pretty good on your leg exam you do have some one plus pitting edema or actually almost one and a half plus pitting edema in your both of your ankles no calf tenderness negative homans sign that means no blood clots otherwise neurologic exam is normal the rest of your exam is normal so what does this all mean so let me explain that so for the first problem the shortness of breath you know i think you have an exacerbation of your congestive heart failure what i'd like to do is increase your dose of lasix from twenty milligrams to sixty milligrams for the next four days i'm gon na have you check your weights everyday and also i'm gon na go ahead and have you use your albuterol and atrovent we had given you some inhalers in the past i can give you another refill if you need to help with that some of the breathing that you're having the shortness of breath so i'd like to get some of this fluid off you have you check your weights daily we'll have you increase your dose of lasix we'll have you use a breathing treatments and see if that helps your shortness of breath i'd like to have you come back in about couple days actually i wan na see how you're doing and if it does n't get better we may have to increase the dose or send you to the hospital okay
[patient] i do n't want to go to the hospital doctor
[doctor] yeah so let's try to let's try to use the lasix and let's try to let's try to you know use the breathing treatments and and do that for the second problem the diabetes that we just talked about i like to go ahead and order another blood test another hemoglobin a1c i think we need to your blood sugars have been running a little bit high in the past and we've had a hard time but it's been a while since we checked your last one so i wan na check another one today to see where we are and when we have you come back in a couple days we should have the results back we can then adjust your metformin or we may have to adjust some of the you know add a different medication at that point but but right now i'm gon na order some blood tests we'll have you come back in a couple of days and then we can reassess at that point okay
[patient] so i had a piece of cake before i came in here is that gon na affect the the lab work
[doctor] yeah we'll probably do a fasting blood sugar we'll we'll order the hemoglobin a1c that should n't be actually matter because that checks long term but if we need your blood sugar may be elevated today i i would n't be surprised alright and i forgot to examine your back by the way so on your back exam you do have some tenderness in the paraspinal areas of your back in the in the lower back mostly no midline tenderness you have good reflexes so i think this is all muscular pain right now for your back pain i'm gon na go ahead and put you on some naprosyn and some flexeril which is a muscle relaxer i'm gon na give you some exercises you can do to help you get off the couch it'll also help your blood sugar and why do n't we have you if that does n't work the the pain medicine and the physical we can start physical therapy and see if that helps okay

Assessment

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  1. Shortness of breath. - Medical Reasoning: Gloria is a 46-year-old female today with past medical history of diabetes, back pain, and back stress fractures. I have examined her before and she has had exacerbation of her congestive heart failure, as well as past blood sugar elevations. Her blood glucose levels were elevated today. We will order a fasting hemoglobin A1c. She will also be having lasix prescribed for her and albuterol and atrovent refilled for the next 4 days. The patient will follow up with me in 2 days to discuss her progress. If her symptoms do not improve, we may have to adjust her metformin or add a different medication at that point, but but right now I like to go ahead and order another blood test, another hemoglobulin injection.  Diabetes that we just discussed: She has been running a little bit high in the past and we've had a hard time but it's been a while since we checked her last one so i think we should check another one today to see where we are and when we have her come back in a couple days We should have the results back then. Plan  Increases dose of Lasix from 20 mg to 60 mg for 4 Days. Permissive to use breathing treatments. Use ALBUTEROL and RESTOREACTIVEN as needed. Physical therapy can be started later if she continues to have difficulty breathing. Otherwise, she can start formal physical therapy to work on her muscles, which should result in decreased muscular pain. All upper extremities are well within the normal range. No midline tenderness, muscle tension, or swelling, although, her calves are profusely bruised. A muscle relaxer and flexeril prescribed by the doctor were also prescribed to help with her breathing issues.","Subjective

Right elbow pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Lawrence Butler is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right elbow pain.

Over the past week, the patient has developed 6/10 pain in the ""inside"" of his right elbow. The pain may radiate into his forearm on occasion, but does not extend up to his shoulder. He denies any history of trauma or injury, but he did start making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic and suspects that his symptoms could be related to that. His symptoms affect his ability to lift objects or perform his typical activities of daily living. Ibuprofen provides minimal symptomatic relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that he began making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that he has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right elbow pain.

VITALS

Normal

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right elbow: Moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle. No pain with supination of the forearm. Pain with pronation of the forearm. Pain with resistance against flexion of the wrist.

RESULTS

X-ray imaging of the right elbow was obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

Right medial epicondylitis.

PLAN

The patient and I discussed his diagnosis in detail, and I explained that his symptoms are likely caused by overuse and potential damage of the tendons. We will provide him with sling to be worn during the day while he is awake. I want him to take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours with food for a full week and ice the elbow for 20 minutes, 3 times daily. Finally, I advised the patient to rest his elbow and avoid doing any pottery for the next couple of weeks.

[doctor] okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics
[patient] i think he called in ten days' worth and i'm on day six or seven right now i know i've got about two or three days left
[doctor] okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now
[patient] yeah it was it was stinging initially like i had just done something small but at this point it's it's really like throbbing it's almost like there is a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard and i've noticed that every time that i push that i feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap and then noticed that i've been coughing a lot the last two days and then i've noticed that i've had like difficult time catching my breath when i'm walking around the house and so it's almost like two different things going on at this point
[doctor] okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that

[doctor] okay
[patient] i used to be on an insulin pump and i had an a1c that at one point was like thirteen but we worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it's at now i've been six point seven for probably two years now and i rarely have a blood sugar that goes over two hundred i check two or three times a day if i feel weird i'll check it again but i noticed my sugars have probably been trending in the three to four hundreds the last two weeks and then i had one spike at one point at like five or six hundred that got our attention and i think that's also what made my wife call the primary care doc
[doctor] okay now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park

Non-healing ulcer on his right foot.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicholas Gutierrez is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a non-healing ulcer on his right foot. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 6 weeks ago, after wearing a pair of shoes that were too tight.

Today, he describes a burning, stinging, and throbbing sensation. The patient reports a blister on the pad of the plantar aspect of his foot around his heel. He explains that he has been ambulating on the anterior aspect of his foot. He explains that the top part of the skin of the blister detached, which revealed a thick, soft, mushy skin associated with unpleasant smell and yellow drainage. The patient called his primary care physician, who referred him to our office. He was prescribed a 10-day course of antibiotics approximately 6 days ago. He experienced chills and a fever of 99.7 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient denies any nausea or vomiting. He states that when he started the antibiotics, his foot began to feel pretty good. However, he has now noticed that his foot has turned black around the outside of the wound, and he is experiencing cramping in his calf muscle as well. He also reports a burning red streak that was coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle. While palpating his calf, he has noted stiffness in the muscle that is now up to the patella. The patient reports that he has been coughing a lot over the last 2 days. He has experienced shortness of breath with ambulation around the house. He reports that he purchases new diabetic shoes yearly and changes the inserts every 3 to 4 months.

The patient is diabetic and has diabetic neuropathy. He explains that his blood sugar has been trending in the 300 to 400's over the last 2 weeks. At one point, he had a blood sugar spike to either 500 or 600. He states that his last hemoglobin A1c was 6.7, which has been his average for approximately 2 years. The patient checks his blood sugar 2 to 3 times per day and rarely has a blood sugar that goes over 200. He explains that he used to be on an insulin pump and had an A1c that at one point was 13. He states that he worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it is now.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports a history of diabetic neuropathy.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient enjoys hiking.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports subjective fever and chills
Respiratory: Reports cough and shortness of breath with ambulation.
Gastrointestinal: Denies nausea and vomiting.
Musculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain and right calf cramping.
Skin: Reports right foot ulcer with yellow foul smelling drainage, and red streaking coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle.

VITALS

Temperature is slightly elevated.
Vitals are otherwise good.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Edema and pain in calf. Bilateral palpable femoral and papiteal pulses are present. I do not recognize a palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulse; however, they are present via Doppler.
MSK: Examination of the right foot: The necrotic wound on his heel is present. It is approximately 2 cm x 2 cm. I do recognize the sloughing of the tissue, as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area, and erythema. An odor is present from the wound. I do not appreciate any bony exposure now. No pain to palpation in the effected area.

RESULTS

3 views of the right foot were taken today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis or infection.

ASSESSMENT

Right non-healing diabetic foot ulcer.
Diabetes.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that I do not see any evidence of osteomyelitis. I am concerned about the redness that is moving up his leg, as well as the swelling, and pain that he has in his calf. I have recommended that we obtain a venous ultrasound to check his blood supply for the wound. I have also recommended that we perform a debridement of the wound today. We may have to obtain a culture and look at different antibiotic therapy. I am recommending that he continue with antibiotics that his primary care physician prescribed.

In regard to his diabetes, I have advised him to follow up with his endocrinologist to ensure that we do continue to keep his hemoglobin A1c below 7. We will need to closely monitor his blood sugar since we are going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and potentially some other medications depending on the culture results.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 7 days to check on his progress.", [doctor] hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks like he sent you over for a nonhealing foot ulcer on your right foot

now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park [patient] i do n't feel that right there [doctor] okay i'm gon na review the results of your right foot x-ray that we did when you came in today the good news is i do n't see any evidence of osteomyelitis meaning that there is no infection of the bone so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for this nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer i'm going to order a test to check blood supply for this wound also i'm going to do a debridement today in the office we may have to look at we are going to do a culture and we may have to look at different antibiotic therapy i am concerned about the redness that's moving up your leg as well as this the the swelling and pain that you have in your calf so we're gon na monitor this very closely i wan na see you again in seven days and then as far as your diabetes is concerned i do want you to follow up with your endocrinologist and make sure that we do continue to keep your hemoglobin a1c below seven and we're gon na need to closely monitor your blood sugars since we're going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and and potentially some other medications any other questions comments or concerns before i have the nurse come in we're gon na prep you for that procedure [patient] no not really so you're gon na continue the antibiotics that i'm on and possibly extend or call in a new antibiotic depending on the culture [doctor] correct [patient] if i heard [doctor] yep that's correct so what we're gon na do is you said you're six days in do a ten or twelve day course so we're gon na go ahead and continue your antibiotics therapy that your pcp put you on i do want to get the culture back and then we'll make the determination as far as additional or changing that antibiotic therapy [patient] okay sounds good, [doctor] hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks like he sent you over for a nonhealing foot ulcer on your right foot can you tell me about how long you've had that [patient] yeah i've had the boot for about six weeks i first noticed it when i put on a pair of shoes that were little bit too tight i felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister i did n't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and i just had been walking on the front part of my foot i started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and i noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unroofed or the the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so and barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you he started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and i never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature it was about ninety nine point seven and then at one point i had to put on an extra blanket in bed because i had some chills and when i started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and i'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it [doctor] okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics [patient] i think he called in ten days' worth and i'm on day six or seven right now i know i've got about two or three days left [doctor] okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now [patient] yeah it was it was stinging initially like i had just done something small but at this point it's it's really like throbbing it's almost like there is a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard and i've noticed that every time that i push that i feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap and then noticed that i've been coughing a lot the last two days and then i've noticed that i've had like difficult time catching my breath when i'm walking around the house and so it's almost like two different things going on at this point [doctor] okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that [patient] yeah my my a1c is six point seven it's pretty well controlled [doctor] okay [patient] i used to be on an insulin pump and i had an a1c that at one point was like thirteen but we worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it's at now i've been six point seven for probably two years now and i rarely have a blood sugar that goes over two hundred i check two or three times a day if i feel weird i'll check it again but i noticed my sugars have probably been trending in the three to four hundreds the last two weeks and then i had one spike at one point at like five or six hundred that got our attention and i think that's also what made my wife call the primary care doc [doctor] okay now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park [patient] yeah we actually hiked to charlie's bunion about a week before this i've had a new pair of diabetic shoes and inserts i get those every year i changed the inserts every three or four months i mean i've been in cruise control as far as that goes for some time i did get a new pair of shoes the prosthetist told me to check my feet every day for the first week or two which we did i did go hiking about the third or fourth day and i think that might be what caused it as i just went too far when we were hiking but yeah the trails are the trails are gorgeous they're open it's time to to be outside and i'm sorta stuck with this right now [doctor] absolutely yeah my wife and i like to go back there and and hike those trails as well so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam for your vital signs i do recognize a slight fever however your vitals themselves look good now on your foot exam i do recognize the necrotic wound on your heel as you mentioned it is present it's approximately two by two centimeters i i do recognize the sloughing of the of the tissue as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area as well as erythemia so now unfortunately i do also smell the odor you are correct it is it does it is odds but i do not appreciate any bony exposure now on vascular exam i do have bilateral palpable pulses femorally and popliteal pulses are present however i do n't recognize a palpable pulse dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial however i did use the doppler and they are present via doppler now i'm gon na press on the actual affected area of the wound do you have any pain there [patient] i do n't feel that right there [doctor] okay i'm gon na review the results of your right foot x-ray that we did when you came in today the good news is i do n't see any evidence of osteomyelitis meaning that there is no infection of the bone so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for this nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer i'm going to order a test to

[patient] it's it's probably with with with the metformin it seems to be you know one twenty
[doctor] good
[patient] pretty regular
[doctor] good your blood sugars are running in the one twenties that's really good okay alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam okay so i'm looking here at your vital signs and your vital signs look really good i do think you're doing a good job with taking your lisinopril your blood pressure's about one twenty two over seventy right now which is right where we want it your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty seven again which is right where we want it and i do n't appreciate any fever today you you have a normal temperature at ninety eight . four which is really good so i'm just gon na be going ahead and calling out some physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay so on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur rub or gallop on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally on your right knee exam i do appreciate some erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuance over your right patella now does it hurt when i press
[patient] it's a little bit sore
[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and i'm just gon na bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all
[patient] no no it's just more of the typical grinding that i would feel
[doctor] okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day
[patient] we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so
[doctor] do you have any questions about that
[patient] yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just
[doctor] yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this
[patient] you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing
[doctor] if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound
[patient] that's fine
[doctor] great and then for your third problem of your diabetes i wan na just go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and continue you on the metformin one thousand milligrams twice a day it sounds like you're doing a good job since your blood sugars are running in the one twenties i do n't think we need to make any adjustments but we'll see what the hemoglobin a1c shows that gives us a an idea of what your blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis how does that sound
[patient] okay at what point time do you start kinda checking kidney function i've been told that metformin can possibly cause some kidney issues
[doctor] so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable
[patient] okay that'd be good
[doctor] okay anything else
[patient] not that i can think of at this time as soon as i leave
[doctor] well you know where to find me okay
[patient] alright
[doctor] take care bye","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Integumentary
- Examination: There is evidence of a bull’s eye rash over the right knee.

RESULTS

Patient's previous kidney function is within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Tick bite.
- Medical Reasoning: My concern is that he might have Lyme disease based on the presentation of his right knee.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed blood testing to determine if he does in fact have Lyme disease. I explained that Lyme disease can cause problems with other organs if not treated appropriately. We discussed that sometimes antibiotics need to be administered intravenously if oral antibiotics are not given early enough. We will see how he does with a course of oral antibiotics as I would like to avoid intravenous antibiotics.
- Medical Treatment: Prescription for doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 3 weeks provided. Lyme titer and Western blot will be obtained to determine if he has Lyme disease.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This is well-controlled at this time.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed that he is doing really well monitoring his blood pressure at home.
- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg once a day. Lipid panel ordered to assess his cholesterol levels.

3. Diabetes type 2.
- Medical Reasoning: He is doing a good job managing his diabetes since his blood sugars are running in the 120s. I do not think we need to make any adjustments, but we will see what the hemoglobin A1c shows as that gives us an idea of what his blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that metformin can affect kidney function; however, his kidney function was last checked 2 months ago, and it has remained within normal limits.
- Medical Treatment: Continue metformin 1000 mg twice a day. Hemoglobin A1c ordered. Basic metabolic panel ordered to assess kidney function. 

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.", [doctor] hi richard how are you the medical assistant told me that you have a tick bite is that

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Richard Mitchell is a pleasant 67-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a tick bite in his left knee. He states he got the bite from going out in the woods recently and spends a lot of time outdoors. When he was younger, he used to get ticks all the time because of his propensity to spend time with tick bites. Today he denies any fever, chills, coughs, or shortness of breath. The patient also reports a bull's-eye rash on his right knee, which he describes as a type of inflammation that is located over the right patella. This rash is known to cause erythema and edema in that individual. His medical assistant told him that he has a tuck bite around his knee but he does not recall when he first began taking lisinopril. Mr. Mitchell denies having any symptoms from the medication since we started it approximately 2 years ago, when we were taking it for approximately 1 year, and he is unaware of any new side effects to his medication. Having said that, we did begin administering metformin twice daily a few weeks ago when hunting season was open in some parts of the country.

This rash is known to cause erythema and edema in that individual. His medical assistant told him that he has a tuck bite around his knee but he does not recall when he first began taking lisinopril. Mr. Mitchell denies having any symptoms from the medication since we started it approximately 2 years ago, when we were taking it for approximately 1 year, and he is unaware of any new side effects to his medication. Having said that, we did begin administering metformin twice daily a few weeks ago when hunting season was open in some parts of the country. Additionally, the patient has been taking Adobee®, a software that helps to design and manage hunters'risk by integrating software for designing and managing their pray.

Assessment

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  1. Possible lyme disease. - Medical Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms consistent with a tick bite. His skin examination demonstrates evidence of a bull's-eye rash. He has been previously been treated with antibiotics but has had some adverse reactions including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. I recommend a western blot and a Lyme titer to further evaluate his symptoms. We will also order a lipid panel to check for abnormalities. If these tests come back normal, we will continue with oral antibiotics.","Subjective

CHIEF COMPLAINT  Tick bite.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Henry Walker is a pleasant 66-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of lyme disease. He states that he has been out in the woods since approximately 2 years ago and has not been able to shoot or bring home anything. The patient was told that windle season is open and that his diabetes is likely to be linked with that. She denies any fever, chills, dyspnea, swelling, or swelling since her knee was bitten on 05/06/09. Her diabetes was noted during the course of her visit today as well as some other symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath or dizziness, etcetera. However, she notes that she is not aware of any side effects from the metformin 1,000 mg twice a day, which sounds like you're doing a good job since your blood sugars are running below 1/10th of a kilo, however, this is still over a week and she does not appreciate any murmur rub or gallop on the knee since the tick bite started 1 week ago. This is nothing other than her typical arthritic pain. When was the last time that you went hunting? Not long ago couple of weeks ago, but most of the time since that started, the family has had grandchildren with me so i let them have what they wanted;)  SOCIAL HATICS  DOxycycline 100 mg 2 day. Diodical Metrological Metrosexycycystine 500 mg. Blood pressure is normalizing on that knee despite the fact that it burns when i press it.
